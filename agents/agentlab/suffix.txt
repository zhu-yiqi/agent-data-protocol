# Next action

You will now think step by step and produce your next best action. Reflect on your past actions, any resulting error message, the current state of the page before deciding on your next action. Provide your output as a single json with a thought and an action. All reasoning must be contained within the thought key of the json output, and only a single action must be provided for the action key. Future actions will be taken subsequently. If you have finished performing the request, send a message to the user in a concise and to the point manner.
