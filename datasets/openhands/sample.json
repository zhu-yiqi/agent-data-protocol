It is used to reduce the amount of typing required at each step in your code, thus making it more readable and maintainable by others (and yourself).\nint add(int a, int b) {    // function definition with parameters for two integers ‘a’ & 'b' which are passed as arguments. The return type is integer because the sum of any numbers can be an Integer in C++ language so we use data types like \"integer\" (`int`).\n   cout << a + b;          // print out/return result by adding two integers ‘a’ and 'b'. This will display their Sum. If you want to return the sum, then replace `cout<<...` with your own logic for returning value from function in C++ language (like using data structure like struct or class).\n   // if a + b is not an integer type of operation it can be done as follows:  int c = static_cast<int>(a)+static_cast<int>(b); return c;. But this will only work for simple operations and may lead to loss in precision when the sum exceeds maximum limit (like `INT32 MAX`).\n}                                                            // end of function definition ‘add’ with parameters 'a' & 'b'.  \n```                                                                    //end C++ code block here.

broken copy of cmake is installed on your system.\n          It is unfortunately very common for python package managers to include\n          broken copies of cmake.  So if the error above this refers to some file\n          path to a cmake file inside a python or anaconda or miniconda path then you\n          should delete that broken copy of cmake from your computer.\n      \n          Instead, please get an official copy of cmake from one of these known good\n          sources of an official cmake:\n              - cmake.org (this is how windows users should get cmake)\n              - apt install cmake (for Ubuntu or Debian based systems)\n              - yum install cmake (for Redhat or CenOS based systems)\n      \n          On a linux machine you can run `which cmake` to see what cmake you are\n          actually using.  If it tells you it's some cmake from any kind of python\n          packager delete it and install an official cmake.\n      \n          More generally, cmake is not installed if when you open a terminal window\n          and type\n             cmake --version\n          you get an error.  So you can use that as a very basic test to see if you\n          have cmake installed.  That is, if cmake --version doesn't run from the\n          same terminal window from which you are reading this error message, then\n          you have not installed cmake.  Windows users should take note that they\n          need to tell the cmake installer to add cmake to their PATH.  Since you\n          can't run commands that are not in your PATH.

So if the error above this refers to some file\n          path to a cmake file inside a python or anaconda or miniconda path then you\n          should delete that broken copy of cmake from your computer.\n      \n          Instead, please get an official copy of cmake from one of these known good\n          sources of an official cmake:\n              - cmake.org (this is how windows users should get cmake)\n              - apt install cmake (for Ubuntu or Debian based systems)\n              - yum install cmake (for Redhat or CenOS based systems)\n      \n          On a linux machine you can run `which cmake` to see what cmake you are\n          actually using.  If it tells you it's some cmake from any kind of python\n          packager delete it and install an official cmake.\n      \n          More generally, cmake is not installed if when you open a terminal window\n          and type\n             cmake --version\n          you get an error.  So you can use that as a very basic test to see if you\n          have cmake installed.  That is, if cmake --version doesn't run from the\n          same terminal window from which you are reading this error message, then\n          you have not installed cmake.  Windows users should take note that they\n          need to tell the cmake installer to add cmake to their PATH.  Since you\n          can't run commands that are not in your PATH.
