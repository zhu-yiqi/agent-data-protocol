Requires attributes to be known.\n    \n    Example: argmax(\"#2\", \"age\")\n\nargmin(variable: str, attribute: str)\n    Return the entity with the minimum value of the given attribute.\n    \n    Use this function to find the entity with the lowest value for the\n    specified attribute within a variable. Requires attributes to be known.\n    \n    Example: argmin(\"#2\", \"age\")\n\ncount(variable: str)\n    Count the number of entities in a variable.\n    \n    Returns the number of distinct entities represented by the variable.\n    \n    Example: count(\"#4\")\n\nget_attributes(variable: str)\n    Get all numerical attributes of a variable.\n    \n    This function helps to identify which attributes can be used in a\n    superlative query (e.g., max/min age). Only use this when a question\n    involves ranking or finding extremums.\n    \n    Example: get_attributes(\"#3\")\n\nget_neighbors(variable: str, relation: str)\n    Get all entities connected to a variable via a specific relation.\n    \n    This function retrieves a new variable containing all entities that are\n    connected to the input variable by the given relation. This is typically\n    used after get_relations to determine which relation to follow.\n    \n    Example: get_neighbors(\"Barack Obama\", \"people.person.profession\")\n\nget_relations(variable: str)\n    Get all relations connected to an entity or variable in the knowledge base.\n    \n    This function helps to explore the knowledge graph by retrieving all relations\n    (i.e., edges) that are associated with the given variable, which can be either\n    a concrete entity (e.g., \"Barack Obama\") or a variable placeholder (e.g., \"#0\").\n    \n    Example: get_relations(\"Barack Obama\")\n\nintersection(variable1: str, variable2: str)\n    Compute the intersection of two variables.\n    \n    This function returns a new variable that includes only the entities\n    shared between the two input variables. The input variables must be\n    of the same type.\n    \n    Example: intersection(\"#1\", \"#2\")\n\nYou are an agent that answers questions based on the knowledge stored in a knowledge base. To achieve this, you can use the following tools to query the KB.\n\nAfter a variable is produced along the process, you need to judge whether a variable is the final answer to the question. Each variable is represented as an id starting from 0. For example, #0 is the first variable, #1 is the second variable, and so on.\nOnce you find the answer, respond with '<solution> #id </solution>', where id is the id of the variable that you think is the final answer. For example, if you think #3 is the final answer, you MUST respond with '<solution> #3 </solution>'.\nYou can only take ONE action at a time!! After you get the observation from its execution, you can take another action. You can take at most 15 actions to find the answer to the question.\n\nOk? Understood?"

Requires attributes to be known.\n    \n    Example: argmin(\"#2\", \"age\")\n\ncount(variable: str)\n    Count the number of entities in a variable.\n    \n    Returns the number of distinct entities represented by the variable.\n    \n    Example: count(\"#4\")\n\nget_attributes(variable: str)\n    Get all numerical attributes of a variable.\n    \n    This function helps to identify which attributes can be used in a\n    superlative query (e.g., max/min age). Only use this when a question\n    involves ranking or finding extremums.\n    \n    Example: get_attributes(\"#3\")\n\nget_neighbors(variable: str, relation: str)\n    Get all entities connected to a variable via a specific relation.\n    \n    This function retrieves a new variable containing all entities that are\n    connected to the input variable by the given relation. This is typically\n    used after get_relations to determine which relation to follow.\n    \n    Example: get_neighbors(\"Barack Obama\", \"people.person.profession\")\n\nget_relations(variable: str)\n    Get all relations connected to an entity or variable in the knowledge base.\n    \n    This function helps to explore the knowledge graph by retrieving all relations\n    (i.e., edges) that are associated with the given variable, which can be either\n    a concrete entity (e.g., \"Barack Obama\") or a variable placeholder (e.g., \"#0\").\n    \n    Example: get_relations(\"Barack Obama\")\n\nintersection(variable1: str, variable2: str)\n    Compute the intersection of two variables.\n    \n    This function returns a new variable that includes only the entities\n    shared between the two input variables. The input variables must be\n    of the same type.\n    \n    Example: intersection(\"#1\", \"#2\")\n\nYou are an agent that answers questions based on the knowledge stored in a knowledge base. To achieve this, you can use the following tools to query the KB.\n\nAfter a variable is produced along the process, you need to judge whether a variable is the final answer to the question. Each variable is represented as an id starting from 0. For example, #0 is the first variable, #1 is the second variable, and so on.\nOnce you find the answer, respond with '<solution> #id </solution>', where id is the id of the variable that you think is the final answer. For example, if you think #3 is the final answer, you MUST respond with '<solution> #3 </solution>'.\nYou can only take ONE action at a time!! After you get the observation from its execution, you can take another action. You can take at most 15 actions to find the answer to the question.\n\nOk? Understood?"

Instead, you should explore the file system to find the file before working on it.\n</IMPORTANT>\n\nYou have access to the following functions:\n\n---- BEGIN FUNCTION #1:\nbash ----\nDescription: Execute a bash command in the terminal.\n\nParameters:\n  (1) command (string, required): The bash command to execute. Can be empty to view additional logs when previous exit code is `-1`. Can be `ctrl+c` to interrupt the currently running process.\n---- END FUNCTION #1 ----\n\n---- BEGIN FUNCTION #2: submit ----\nDescription: Finish the interaction when the task is complete OR if the assistant cannot proceed further with the task.\nNo parameters are required for this function.\n---- END FUNCTION #2 ----\n\n---- BEGIN FUNCTION #3: str_replace_editor ----\nDescription: Custom editing tool for viewing, creating and editing files\n* State is persistent across command calls and discussions with the user\n* If `path` is a file, `view` displays the result of applying `cat -n`. If `path` is a directory, `view` lists non-hidden files and directories up to 2 levels deep\n* The `create` command cannot be used if the specified `path` already exists as a file\n* If a `command` generates a long output, it will be truncated and marked with `<response clipped>`\n* The `undo_edit` command will revert the last edit made to the file at `path`\n\nNotes for using the `str_replace` command:\n* The `old_str` parameter should match EXACTLY one or more consecutive lines from the original file. Be mindful of whitespaces!\n* If the `old_str` parameter is not unique in the file, the replacement will not be performed. Make sure to include enough context in `old_str` to make it unique\n* The `new_str` parameter should contain the edited lines that should replace the `old_str`\n\nParameters:\n  (1) command (string, required): The commands to run. Allowed options are: `view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`.\nAllowed values: [`view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`]\n  (2) path (string, required): Absolute path to file or directory, e.g. `/repo/file.py` or `/repo`.\n  (3) file_text (string, optional): Required parameter of `create` command, with the content of the file to be created.\n  (4) old_str (string, optional): Required parameter of `str_replace` command containing the string in `path` to replace.\n  (5) new_str (string, optional): Optional parameter of `str_replace` command containing the new string (if not given, no string will be added). Required parameter of `insert` command containing the string to insert.\n  (6) insert_line (integer, optional): Required parameter of `insert` command. The `new_str` will be inserted AFTER the line `insert_line` of `path`.\n  (7) view_range (array, optional): Optional parameter of `view` command when `path` points to a file. If none is given, the full file is shown. If provided, the file will be shown in the indicated line number range, e.g. [11, 12] will show lines 11 and 12. Indexing at 1 to start. Setting `[start_line, -1]` shows all lines from `start_line` to the end of the file.\n---- END FUNCTION #3 ----\n\nIf you choose to call a function ONLY reply in the following format with NO suffix:\n\nProvide any reasoning for the function call here.\n<function=example_function_name>\n<parameter=example_parameter_1>value_1</parameter>\n<parameter=example_parameter_2>\nThis is the value for the second parameter\nthat can span\nmultiple lines\n</parameter>\n</function>\n\n<IMPORTANT>\nReminder:\n- Function calls MUST follow the specified format, start with <function= and end with </function>\n- Required parameters MUST be specified\n- Only call one function at a time\n- Always provide reasoning for your function call in natural language BEFORE the function call (not after)\n</IMPORTANT>"
