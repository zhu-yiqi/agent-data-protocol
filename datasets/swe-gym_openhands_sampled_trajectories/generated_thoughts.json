This final execution will confirm whether the `configure.ac` file is correctly found and processed in the build directory and that our PR changes fully address the original issue.",
    "59": "I noticed that we switched from setting a `self.build_folder` attribute to using a local `build_folder = os.getcwd()` variable inside `build()`. Any remaining reference to `self.build_folder` will still cause attribute errors. To keep things consistent and ensure `chdir` uses the correct directory, I’m replacing `with chdir(self, self.build_folder):` with `with chdir(self, build_folder):`.

Rather than continuing to randomly leap forward, I’ll try a middle ground around lines 2500–2600. There’s a good chance the reduction utilities are clustered in that central region.

This slice often contains the setup for default dtypes and any preliminary casting steps.

That cast is exactly what causes a `uint64` Series to underflow when its value exceeds the signed 64-bit limit. To fix this, I’m inserting a special case ahead of the generic integer branch: if the input dtype is exactly `uint64`, we keep the accumulator as `uint64` instead of upcasting to `float64`. The replacement adds an `elif dtype.kind == 'u' and dtype.itemsize == 8:` check that preserves `dtype_sum = dtype`, then falls back to the existing logic for all other integer kinds.",

Pinpointing this will guide where to apply a robust fix to preserve full unsigned precision.",

    "97": "At this point in the `nanops.nansum` function, the code always calls `_get_dtype_max(dtype)` to pick an accumulator type, which forces even 64-bit unsigned inputs to downcast into a signed or floating type—causing the underflow bug we observed. To correct this, I’m inserting a special‐case branch: if the incoming dtype is exactly `uint64` (`kind == 'u'` and `itemsize == 8`), we keep `dtype_sum = dtype`; otherwise we fall back to the original `_get_dtype_max` behavior. This patch ensures that summation on `uint64` Series retains full 64-bit unsigned precision without underflowing."
