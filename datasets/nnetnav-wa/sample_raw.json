        "content": "You are an autonomous intelligent agent tasked with navigating a web browser. You will be given web-based tasks. These tasks will be accomplished through the use of specific actions you can issue.\n\nHere's the information you'll have:\nThe user's objective: This is the task you're trying to complete.\nThe current web page's accessibility tree: This is a simplified representation of the webpage, providing key information.\nThe current web page's URL: This is the page you're currently navigating.\nThe open tabs: These are the tabs you have open.\nThe previous actions: These are all the action you have performed. It may be helpful to track your progress.\n\nThe actions you can perform fall into several categories:\n\nPage Operation Actions:\n`click [id]`: This action clicks on an element with a specific id on the webpage.\n`type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]`: Use this to type the content into the field with id. By default, the \"Enter\" key is pressed after typing unless press_enter_after is set to 0.\n`hover [id]`: Hover over an element with id.\n`press [key_comb]`:  Simulates the pressing of a key combination on the keyboard (e.g., Ctrl+v).\n`scroll [down|up]`: Scroll the page up or down.\n\nTab Management Actions:\n`new_tab`: Open a new, empty browser tab.\n`tab_focus [tab_index]`: Switch the browser's focus to a specific tab using its index.\n`close_tab`: Close the currently active tab.\n\nURL Navigation Actions:\n`goto [url]`: Navigate to a specific URL.\n`go_back`: Navigate to the previously viewed page.\n`go_forward`: Navigate to the next page (if a previous 'go_back' action was performed).\n\nCompletion Action:\n`stop [answer]`: Issue this action when you believe the task is complete. If the objective is to find a text-based answer, provide the answer in the bracket. If you believe the task is impossible to complete, provide the answer as \"N/A\" in the bracket.\n\nHomepage:\nIf you want to visit other websites, check out the homepage at http://homepage.com. It has a list of websites you can visit.\n\nTo be successful, it is very important to follow the following rules:\n1. You should only issue an action that is valid given the current observation\n2. You should only issue one action at a time.\n3. You should follow the examples to reason step by step and then issue the next action.\n4. You are strictly forbidden from issuing a goto action to a URL that is not on the homepage.\n5. Generate the action in the correct format. Start by reasoning about the current situation. End with \"In summary, the next action I will perform is\" phrase, followed by action inside ``````. For example, \"Let's think step-by-step. Given the current state, I need to click on the like button which has id 1234. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```click [1234]```\".\n6. Issue stop action when you think you have achieved the objective. Don't generate anything after stop. \n\nHere are some example outputs for some random tasks:\n1. Let's think step-by-step. This page list the information of HP Inkjet Fax Machine, which is the product identified in the objective. Its price is $279.49. I think I have achieved the objective. I will issue the stop action with the answer. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```stop [$279.49]```\n2. Let's think step-by-step. This page has a search box whose ID is [164]. According to the nominatim rule of openstreetmap, I can search for the restaurants near a location by \"restaurants near\". I can submit my typing by pressing the Enter afterwards. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```type [164] [restaurants near CMU] [1]```"

These tasks will be accomplished through the use of specific actions you can issue.\n\nHere's the information you'll have:\nThe user's objective: This is the task you're trying to complete.\nThe current web page's accessibility tree: This is a simplified representation of the webpage, providing key information.\nThe current web page's URL: This is the page you're currently navigating.\nThe open tabs: These are the tabs you have open.\nThe previous actions: These are all the action you have performed. It may be helpful to track your progress.\n\nThe actions you can perform fall into several categories:\n\nPage Operation Actions:\n`click [id]`: This action clicks on an element with a specific id on the webpage.\n`type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]`: Use this to type the content into the field with id. By default, the \"Enter\" key is pressed after typing unless press_enter_after is set to 0.\n`hover [id]`: Hover over an element with id.\n`press [key_comb]`:  Simulates the pressing of a key combination on the keyboard (e.g., Ctrl+v).\n`scroll [down|up]`: Scroll the page up or down.\n\nTab Management Actions:\n`new_tab`: Open a new, empty browser tab.\n`tab_focus [tab_index]`: Switch the browser's focus to a specific tab using its index.\n`close_tab`: Close the currently active tab.\n\nURL Navigation Actions:\n`goto [url]`: Navigate to a specific URL.\n`go_back`: Navigate to the previously viewed page.\n`go_forward`: Navigate to the next page (if a previous 'go_back' action was performed).\n\nCompletion Action:\n`stop [answer]`: Issue this action when you believe the task is complete. If the objective is to find a text-based answer, provide the answer in the bracket. If you believe the task is impossible to complete, provide the answer as \"N/A\" in the bracket.\n\nHomepage:\nIf you want to visit other websites, check out the homepage at http://homepage.com. It has a list of websites you can visit.\n\nTo be successful, it is very important to follow the following rules:\n1. You should only issue an action that is valid given the current observation\n2. You should only issue one action at a time.\n3. You should follow the examples to reason step by step and then issue the next action.\n4. You are strictly forbidden from issuing a goto action to a URL that is not on the homepage.\n5. Generate the action in the correct format. Start by reasoning about the current situation. End with \"In summary, the next action I will perform is\" phrase, followed by action inside ``````. For example, \"Let's think step-by-step. Given the current state, I need to click on the like button which has id 1234. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```click [1234]```\".\n6. Issue stop action when you think you have achieved the objective. Don't generate anything after stop. \n\nHere are some example outputs for some random tasks:\n1. Let's think step-by-step. This page list the information of HP Inkjet Fax Machine, which is the product identified in the objective. Its price is $279.49. I think I have achieved the objective. I will issue the stop action with the answer. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```stop [$279.49]```\n2. Let's think step-by-step. This page has a search box whose ID is [164]. According to the nominatim rule of openstreetmap, I can search for the restaurants near a location by \"restaurants near\". I can submit my typing by pressing the Enter afterwards. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```type [164] [restaurants near CMU] [1]```\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\nOBSERVATION:\nTab 0 (current): Search\n\n[16619] RootWebArea 'Search' focused: True\n\t[16712] link 'Jump to main content'\n\t[16713] link 'Jump to sidebar'\n\t[16721] HeaderAsNonLandmark ''\n\t\t[16722] link 'Home'\n\t\t\t[16752] StaticText 'Postmill'\n\t[16753] link 'Forums'\n\t[16754] link 'Wiki'\n\t[16762] searchbox 'Search query'\n\t\t[17267] StaticText'microdosing for depression'\n\t[16763] link 'Notifications (0)'\n\t[16764] link 'Submit'\n\t[16640] button 'MarvelsGrantMan136' hasPopup: menu expanded: False\n\t[16623] main ''\n\t\t[16715] heading 'Search'\n\t\t[16768] StaticText 'Search query'\n\t\t[16767] searchbox 'Search query'\n\t\t\t[17064] StaticText'microdosing for depression'\n\t\t[16774] button 'Search'\n\t\t[16717] heading '7 results for microdosing for depression:'\n\t\t[16624] article ''\n\t\t\t[16627] HeaderAsNonLandmark ''\n\t\t\t\t[16629] heading 'Study on LSD microdosing uncovers neuropsychological mechanisms that could underlie anti-depressant effects (4 min read) | PsyPost [Dec 2022]'\n\t\t\t\t\t[16630] link 'Study on LSD microdosing uncovers neuropsychological mechanisms that could underlie anti-depressant effects (4 min read) | PsyPost [Dec 2022]'\n\t\t\t\t\t\t[17066] mark ''\n\t\t\t\t\t\t[17067] mark ''\n\t\t\t\t[16780] link 'psypost.org'\n\t\t\t\t[17072] StaticText 'Submitted by '\n\t\t\t\t[16643] link 'NeuronsToNirvana' expanded: False\n\t\t\t\t[17281] StaticText 't3_zbhy0t'\n\t\t\t\t[17076] time 'December 3, 2022 at 9:48:11 AM EST'\n\t\t\t\t\t[17285] StaticText '2 years ago'\n\t\t\t\t[17077] StaticText'in '\n\t\t\t\t[17078] link'science'\n\t\t\t[17288] link 'No comments'\n\t\t\t[16785] button 'Upvote'\n\t\t\t[17081] StaticText '3'\n\t\t\t[16788] button 'Downvote'\n\t\t[16644] article ''\n\t\t\t[16742] checkbox 'Hide −' checked: true\n\t\t\t[16647] HeaderAsNonLandmark ''\n\t\t\t\t[16648] heading 'barbarian818 [t1_itsbkf2] wrote 2 years ago'\n\t\t\t\t\t[16650] link 'barbarian818' expanded: False\n\t\t\t\t\t[17092] time 'October 25, 2022 at 6:59:10 PM EDT'\n\t\t\t\t[16794] StaticText 'Hide −'\n\t\t\t[16803] StaticText 'Reply to '\n\t\t\t[16804] link 'We are Dax Jackson and Ally Lee of Psychedelic Safety Alliance.

        "content": "You are an autonomous intelligent agent tasked with navigating a web browser. You will be given web-based tasks. These tasks will be accomplished through the use of specific actions you can issue.\n\nHere's the information you'll have:\nThe user's objective: This is the task you're trying to complete.\nThe current web page's accessibility tree: This is a simplified representation of the webpage, providing key information.\nThe current web page's URL: This is the page you're currently navigating.\nThe open tabs: These are the tabs you have open.\nThe previous actions: These are all the action you have performed. It may be helpful to track your progress.\n\nThe actions you can perform fall into several categories:\n\nPage Operation Actions:\n`click [id]`: This action clicks on an element with a specific id on the webpage.\n`type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]`: Use this to type the content into the field with id. By default, the \"Enter\" key is pressed after typing unless press_enter_after is set to 0.\n`hover [id]`: Hover over an element with id.\n`press [key_comb]`:  Simulates the pressing of a key combination on the keyboard (e.g., Ctrl+v).\n`scroll [down|up]`: Scroll the page up or down.\n\nTab Management Actions:\n`new_tab`: Open a new, empty browser tab.\n`tab_focus [tab_index]`: Switch the browser's focus to a specific tab using its index.\n`close_tab`: Close the currently active tab.\n\nURL Navigation Actions:\n`goto [url]`: Navigate to a specific URL.\n`go_back`: Navigate to the previously viewed page.\n`go_forward`: Navigate to the next page (if a previous 'go_back' action was performed).\n\nCompletion Action:\n`stop [answer]`: Issue this action when you believe the task is complete. If the objective is to find a text-based answer, provide the answer in the bracket. If you believe the task is impossible to complete, provide the answer as \"N/A\" in the bracket.\n\nHomepage:\nIf you want to visit other websites, check out the homepage at http://homepage.com. It has a list of websites you can visit.\n\nTo be successful, it is very important to follow the following rules:\n1. You should only issue an action that is valid given the current observation\n2. You should only issue one action at a time.\n3. You should follow the examples to reason step by step and then issue the next action.\n4. You are strictly forbidden from issuing a goto action to a URL that is not on the homepage.\n5. Generate the action in the correct format. Start by reasoning about the current situation. End with \"In summary, the next action I will perform is\" phrase, followed by action inside ``````. For example, \"Let's think step-by-step. Given the current state, I need to click on the like button which has id 1234. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```click [1234]```\".\n6. Issue stop action when you think you have achieved the objective. Don't generate anything after stop. \n\nHere are some example outputs for some random tasks:\n1. Let's think step-by-step. This page list the information of HP Inkjet Fax Machine, which is the product identified in the objective. Its price is $279.49. I think I have achieved the objective. I will issue the stop action with the answer. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```stop [$279.49]```\n2. Let's think step-by-step. This page has a search box whose ID is [164]. According to the nominatim rule of openstreetmap, I can search for the restaurants near a location by \"restaurants near\". I can submit my typing by pressing the Enter afterwards. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```type [164] [restaurants near CMU] [1]```"

    "prompt": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\nYou are an autonomous intelligent agent tasked with navigating a web browser. You will be given web-based tasks. These tasks will be accomplished through the use of specific actions you can issue.\n\nHere's the information you'll have:\nThe user's objective: This is the task you're trying to complete.\nThe current web page's accessibility tree: This is a simplified representation of the webpage, providing key information.\nThe current web page's URL: This is the page you're currently navigating.\nThe open tabs: These are the tabs you have open.\nThe previous actions: These are all the action you have performed. It may be helpful to track your progress.\n\nThe actions you can perform fall into several categories:\n\nPage Operation Actions:\n`click [id]`: This action clicks on an element with a specific id on the webpage.\n`type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]`: Use this to type the content into the field with id. By default, the \"Enter\" key is pressed after typing unless press_enter_after is set to 0.\n`hover [id]`: Hover over an element with id.\n`press [key_comb]`:  Simulates the pressing of a key combination on the keyboard (e.g., Ctrl+v).\n`scroll [down|up]`: Scroll the page up or down.\n\nTab Management Actions:\n`new_tab`: Open a new, empty browser tab.\n`tab_focus [tab_index]`: Switch the browser's focus to a specific tab using its index.\n`close_tab`: Close the currently active tab.\n\nURL Navigation Actions:\n`goto [url]`: Navigate to a specific URL.\n`go_back`: Navigate to the previously viewed page.\n`go_forward`: Navigate to the next page (if a previous 'go_back' action was performed).\n\nCompletion Action:\n`stop [answer]`: Issue this action when you believe the task is complete. If the objective is to find a text-based answer, provide the answer in the bracket. If you believe the task is impossible to complete, provide the answer as \"N/A\" in the bracket.\n\nHomepage:\nIf you want to visit other websites, check out the homepage at http://homepage.com. It has a list of websites you can visit.\n\nTo be successful, it is very important to follow the following rules:\n1. You should only issue an action that is valid given the current observation\n2. You should only issue one action at a time.\n3. You should follow the examples to reason step by step and then issue the next action.\n4. You are strictly forbidden from issuing a goto action to a URL that is not on the homepage.\n5. Generate the action in the correct format. Start by reasoning about the current situation. End with \"In summary, the next action I will perform is\" phrase, followed by action inside ``````. For example, \"Let's think step-by-step. Given the current state, I need to click on the like button which has id 1234. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```click [1234]```\".\n6. Issue stop action when you think you have achieved the objective. Don't generate anything after stop. \n\nHere are some example outputs for some random tasks:\n1. Let's think step-by-step. This page list the information of HP Inkjet Fax Machine, which is the product identified in the objective. Its price is $279.49. I think I have achieved the objective. I will issue the stop action with the answer. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```stop [$279.49]```\n2. Let's think step-by-step. This page has a search box whose ID is [164]. According to the nominatim rule of openstreetmap, I can search for the restaurants near a location by \"restaurants near\". I can submit my typing by pressing the Enter afterwards. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```type [164] [restaurants near CMU] [1]```\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\nOBSERVATION:\nTab 0 (current): #000000260 / Orders /

        "content": "You are an autonomous intelligent agent tasked with navigating a web browser. You will be given web-based tasks. These tasks will be accomplished through the use of specific actions you can issue.\n\nHere's the information you'll have:\nThe user's objective: This is the task you're trying to complete.\nThe current web page's accessibility tree: This is a simplified representation of the webpage, providing key information.\nThe current web page's URL: This is the page you're currently navigating.\nThe open tabs: These are the tabs you have open.\nThe previous actions: These are all the action you have performed. It may be helpful to track your progress.\n\nThe actions you can perform fall into several categories:\n\nPage Operation Actions:\n`click [id]`: This action clicks on an element with a specific id on the webpage.\n`type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]`: Use this to type the content into the field with id. By default, the \"Enter\" key is pressed after typing unless press_enter_after is set to 0.\n`hover [id]`: Hover over an element with id.\n`press [key_comb]`:  Simulates the pressing of a key combination on the keyboard (e.g., Ctrl+v).\n`scroll [down|up]`: Scroll the page up or down.\n\nTab Management Actions:\n`new_tab`: Open a new, empty browser tab.\n`tab_focus [tab_index]`: Switch the browser's focus to a specific tab using its index.\n`close_tab`: Close the currently active tab.\n\nURL Navigation Actions:\n`goto [url]`: Navigate to a specific URL.\n`go_back`: Navigate to the previously viewed page.\n`go_forward`: Navigate to the next page (if a previous 'go_back' action was performed).\n\nCompletion Action:\n`stop [answer]`: Issue this action when you believe the task is complete. If the objective is to find a text-based answer, provide the answer in the bracket. If you believe the task is impossible to complete, provide the answer as \"N/A\" in the bracket.\n\nHomepage:\nIf you want to visit other websites, check out the homepage at http://homepage.com. It has a list of websites you can visit.\n\nTo be successful, it is very important to follow the following rules:\n1. You should only issue an action that is valid given the current observation\n2. You should only issue one action at a time.\n3. You should follow the examples to reason step by step and then issue the next action.\n4. You are strictly forbidden from issuing a goto action to a URL that is not on the homepage.\n5. Generate the action in the correct format. Start by reasoning about the current situation. End with \"In summary, the next action I will perform is\" phrase, followed by action inside ``````. For example, \"Let's think step-by-step. Given the current state, I need to click on the like button which has id 1234. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```click [1234]```\".\n6. Issue stop action when you think you have achieved the objective. Don't generate anything after stop. \n\nHere are some example outputs for some random tasks:\n1. Let's think step-by-step. This page list the information of HP Inkjet Fax Machine, which is the product identified in the objective. Its price is $279.49. I think I have achieved the objective. I will issue the stop action with the answer. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```stop [$279.49]```\n2. Let's think step-by-step. This page has a search box whose ID is [164]. According to the nominatim rule of openstreetmap, I can search for the restaurants near a location by \"restaurants near\". I can submit my typing by pressing the Enter afterwards. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```type [164] [restaurants near CMU] [1]```"

These tasks will be accomplished through the use of specific actions you can issue.\n\nHere's the information you'll have:\nThe user's objective: This is the task you're trying to complete.\nThe current web page's accessibility tree: This is a simplified representation of the webpage, providing key information.\nThe current web page's URL: This is the page you're currently navigating.\nThe open tabs: These are the tabs you have open.\nThe previous actions: These are all the action you have performed. It may be helpful to track your progress.\n\nThe actions you can perform fall into several categories:\n\nPage Operation Actions:\n`click [id]`: This action clicks on an element with a specific id on the webpage.\n`type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]`: Use this to type the content into the field with id. By default, the \"Enter\" key is pressed after typing unless press_enter_after is set to 0.\n`hover [id]`: Hover over an element with id.\n`press [key_comb]`:  Simulates the pressing of a key combination on the keyboard (e.g., Ctrl+v).\n`scroll [down|up]`: Scroll the page up or down.\n\nTab Management Actions:\n`new_tab`: Open a new, empty browser tab.\n`tab_focus [tab_index]`: Switch the browser's focus to a specific tab using its index.\n`close_tab`: Close the currently active tab.\n\nURL Navigation Actions:\n`goto [url]`: Navigate to a specific URL.\n`go_back`: Navigate to the previously viewed page.\n`go_forward`: Navigate to the next page (if a previous 'go_back' action was performed).\n\nCompletion Action:\n`stop [answer]`: Issue this action when you believe the task is complete. If the objective is to find a text-based answer, provide the answer in the bracket. If you believe the task is impossible to complete, provide the answer as \"N/A\" in the bracket.\n\nHomepage:\nIf you want to visit other websites, check out the homepage at http://homepage.com. It has a list of websites you can visit.\n\nTo be successful, it is very important to follow the following rules:\n1. You should only issue an action that is valid given the current observation\n2. You should only issue one action at a time.\n3. You should follow the examples to reason step by step and then issue the next action.\n4. You are strictly forbidden from issuing a goto action to a URL that is not on the homepage.\n5. Generate the action in the correct format. Start by reasoning about the current situation. End with \"In summary, the next action I will perform is\" phrase, followed by action inside ``````. For example, \"Let's think step-by-step. Given the current state, I need to click on the like button which has id 1234. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```click [1234]```\".\n6. Issue stop action when you think you have achieved the objective. Don't generate anything after stop. \n\nHere are some example outputs for some random tasks:\n1. Let's think step-by-step. This page list the information of HP Inkjet Fax Machine, which is the product identified in the objective. Its price is $279.49. I think I have achieved the objective. I will issue the stop action with the answer. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```stop [$279.49]```\n2. Let's think step-by-step. This page has a search box whose ID is [164]. According to the nominatim rule of openstreetmap, I can search for the restaurants near a location by \"restaurants near\". I can submit my typing by pressing the Enter afterwards. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```type [164] [restaurants near CMU] [1]```\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\nOBSERVATION:\nRootWebArea 'Postmill', focused,

        "content": "You are an autonomous intelligent agent tasked with navigating a web browser. You will be given web-based tasks. These tasks will be accomplished through the use of specific actions you can issue.\n\nHere's the information you'll have:\nThe user's objective: This is the task you're trying to complete.\nThe current web page's accessibility tree: This is a simplified representation of the webpage, providing key information.\nThe current web page's URL: This is the page you're currently navigating.\nThe open tabs: These are the tabs you have open.\nThe previous actions: These are all the action you have performed. It may be helpful to track your progress.\n\nThe actions you can perform fall into several categories:\n\nPage Operation Actions:\n`click [id]`: This action clicks on an element with a specific id on the webpage.\n`type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]`: Use this to type the content into the field with id. By default, the \"Enter\" key is pressed after typing unless press_enter_after is set to 0.\n`hover [id]`: Hover over an element with id.\n`press [key_comb]`:  Simulates the pressing of a key combination on the keyboard (e.g., Ctrl+v).\n`scroll [down|up]`: Scroll the page up or down.\n\nTab Management Actions:\n`new_tab`: Open a new, empty browser tab.\n`tab_focus [tab_index]`: Switch the browser's focus to a specific tab using its index.\n`close_tab`: Close the currently active tab.\n\nURL Navigation Actions:\n`goto [url]`: Navigate to a specific URL.\n`go_back`: Navigate to the previously viewed page.\n`go_forward`: Navigate to the next page (if a previous 'go_back' action was performed).\n\nCompletion Action:\n`stop [answer]`: Issue this action when you believe the task is complete. If the objective is to find a text-based answer, provide the answer in the bracket. If you believe the task is impossible to complete, provide the answer as \"N/A\" in the bracket.\n\nHomepage:\nIf you want to visit other websites, check out the homepage at http://homepage.com. It has a list of websites you can visit.\n\nTo be successful, it is very important to follow the following rules:\n1. You should only issue an action that is valid given the current observation\n2. You should only issue one action at a time.\n3. You should follow the examples to reason step by step and then issue the next action.\n4. You are strictly forbidden from issuing a goto action to a URL that is not on the homepage.\n5. Generate the action in the correct format. Start by reasoning about the current situation. End with \"In summary, the next action I will perform is\" phrase, followed by action inside ``````. For example, \"Let's think step-by-step. Given the current state, I need to click on the like button which has id 1234. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```click [1234]```\".\n6.

It may be helpful to track your progress.\n\nThe actions you can perform fall into several categories:\n\nPage Operation Actions:\n`click [id]`: This action clicks on an element with a specific id on the webpage.\n`type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]`: Use this to type the content into the field with id. By default, the \"Enter\" key is pressed after typing unless press_enter_after is set to 0.\n`hover [id]`: Hover over an element with id.\n`press [key_comb]`:  Simulates the pressing of a key combination on the keyboard (e.g., Ctrl+v).\n`scroll [down|up]`: Scroll the page up or down.\n\nTab Management Actions:\n`new_tab`: Open a new, empty browser tab.\n`tab_focus [tab_index]`: Switch the browser's focus to a specific tab using its index.\n`close_tab`: Close the currently active tab.\n\nURL Navigation Actions:\n`goto [url]`: Navigate to a specific URL.\n`go_back`: Navigate to the previously viewed page.\n`go_forward`: Navigate to the next page (if a previous 'go_back' action was performed).\n\nCompletion Action:\n`stop [answer]`: Issue this action when you believe the task is complete. If the objective is to find a text-based answer, provide the answer in the bracket. If you believe the task is impossible to complete, provide the answer as \"N/A\" in the bracket.\n\nHomepage:\nIf you want to visit other websites, check out the homepage at http://homepage.com. It has a list of websites you can visit.\n\nTo be successful, it is very important to follow the following rules:\n1. You should only issue an action that is valid given the current observation\n2. You should only issue one action at a time.\n3. You should follow the examples to reason step by step and then issue the next action.\n4. You are strictly forbidden from issuing a goto action to a URL that is not on the homepage.\n5. Generate the action in the correct format. Start by reasoning about the current situation. End with \"In summary, the next action I will perform is\" phrase, followed by action inside ``````. For example, \"Let's think step-by-step. Given the current state, I need to click on the like button which has id 1234. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```click [1234]```\".\n6. Issue stop action when you think you have achieved the objective. Don't generate anything after stop. \n\nHere are some example outputs for some random tasks:\n1. Let's think step-by-step. This page list the information of HP Inkjet Fax Machine, which is the product identified in the objective. Its price is $279.49. I think I have achieved the objective. I will issue the stop action with the answer. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```stop [$279.49]```\n2. Let's think step-by-step. This page has a search box whose ID is [164]. According to the nominatim rule of openstreetmap, I can search for the restaurants near a location by \"restaurants near\". I can submit my typing by pressing the Enter afterwards. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```type [164] [restaurants near CMU] [1]```\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\nOBSERVATION:\nTab 0 (current): KRASTY Morden Mini White Ceramic Table Lamp, Cute Desk Lamp with White Fabric Drum Shade Bedside Nightstand Lamp for Bedroom Living Room Kids Room\n\n[5354] RootWebArea 'KRASTY Morden Mini White Ceramic Table Lamp, Cute Desk Lamp with White Fabric Drum Shade Bedside Nightstand Lamp for Bedroom Living Room Kids Room' focused: True\n\t[6690] link 'My Account'\n\t[6688] link 'My Wish List'\n\t[6692] link 'Sign Out'\n\t[6695] StaticText 'Welcome to One Stop Market'\n\t[6592] link 'Skip to Content'\n\t[6601] link'store logo'\n\t\t[6698] img 'one_stop_market_logo'\n\t[6699] link '\\ue611 My Cart'\n\t[7599] StaticText '\\ue615'\n\t[7600] StaticText 'Search'\n\t[6869] combobox '\\ue615 Search' autocomplete: both hasPopup: listbox required: False expanded: False\n\t[7603] link 'Advanced Search'\n\t[6872] button 'Search' disabled: True\n\t[6465] tablist '' multiselectable: False orientation: horizontal\n\t\t[6467] tabpanel ''\n\t\t\t[5409] menu '' orientation: vertical\n\t\t\t\t[6160] menuitem '\\ue622 Beauty & Personal Care' hasPopup: menu\n\t\t\t\t[6225] menuitem '\\ue622 Sports & Outdoors' hasPopup: menu\n\t\t\t\t[6235] menuitem '\\ue622 Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry' hasPopup: menu\n\t\t\t\t[6249] menuitem '\\ue622 Home & Kitchen' hasPopup: menu\n\t\t\t\t[6286] menuitem '\\ue622 Office Products' hasPopup: menu\n\t\t\t\t[6294] menuitem '\\ue622 Tools & Home Improvement' hasPopup: menu\n\t\t\t\t[6299] menuitem '\\ue622 Health & Household' hasPopup: menu\n\t\t\t\t[6305] menuitem '\\ue622 Patio, Lawn & Garden' hasPopup: menu\n\t\t\t\t[6310] menuitem '\\ue622 Electronics' hasPopup: menu\n\t\t\t\t[6371] menuitem '\\ue622 Cell Phones & Accessories' hasPopup: menu\n\t\t\t\t[6386] menuitem '\\ue622 Video Games' hasPopup: menu\n\t\t\t\t[6399] menuitem '\\ue622 Grocery & Gourmet Food' hasPopup: menu\n\t[6624] link 'Home'\n\t[6703] StaticText '\\ue608'\n\t[6626] link 'Tools & Home Improvement'\n\t[6628] link 'Lighting & Ceiling Fans'\n\t[6630] link 'Lamps & Shades'\n\t[6709] StaticText '\\ue608'\n\t[6633] StaticText 'KRASTY Morden Mini White Ceramic Table Lamp, Cute Desk Lamp with White Fabric Drum Shade Bedside Nightstand Lamp for Bedroom Living Room Kids Room'\n\t[5358] main ''\n\t\t[6634] heading 'KRASTY Morden Mini White Ceramic Table Lamp, Cute Desk Lamp with White Fabric Drum Shade Bedside Nightstand Lamp for Bedroom Living Room Kids Room'\n\t\t[5364] generic 'Availability'\n\t\t\t[5366] StaticText 'IN STOCK'\n\t\t[6713] StaticText 'SKU'\n\t\t[6837] StaticText 'B07YKSG7XF'\n\t\t[6641] LayoutTable ''\n\t\t\t[6715] link 'Be the first to review this product'\n\t\t[6717] StaticText '$28.99'\n\t\t[6655] LayoutTable ''\n\t\t\t[6844] StaticText 'Qty'\n\t\t\t[6845] spinbutton 'Qty' required: False valuemin: 0 valuemax: 0 valuetext: \n\t\t\t\t[7604] StaticText '1'\n\t\t\t[6846] button 'Add to Cart'\n\t\t[6657] link 'Add to Wish List'\n\t\t[6658] link 'Add to Compare'\n\t\t[6663] link 'Skip to the end of the images gallery'\n\t\t[6504] button 'Previous'\n\t\t[6506] generic 'Image'\n\t\t\t[7606] img 'Image'\n\t\t[6505] button 'Next'\n\t\t[7587] button 'Previous'\n\t\t[7610] button 'Image'\n\t\t\t[7967] img 'Image'\n\t\t[7611] button 'Image'\n\t\t\t[7966] img 'Image'\n\t\t[7589] button 'Next'\n\t\t[6666] link 'Skip to the beginning of the images gallery'\n\t\t[6475] tablist '' multiselectable: False orientation: horizontal\n\t\t\t[6476] tab 'Details' expanded: True selected: False controls: description\n\t\t\t\t[6729] link 'Details'\n\t\t\t[6477] tabpanel 'Details'\n\t\t\t\t[7590] separator '' orientation: horizontal\n\t\t\t\t[7591] heading 'Product Description'\n\t\t\t\t[7620] img '132132'\n\t\t\t\t[7623] img '323232'\n\t\t\t\t[7627] StaticText 'Made of ceramic and finished in white with vintage winepot modeling makes it ideal for contemporary settings.It is an indispensable ideal choice for home life.'\n\t\t\t\t[5380] table ''\n\t\t\t\t\t[7770] row ''\n\t\t\t\t\t\t[7771] columnheader '6666' required: False\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t[7839] img '6666'\n\t\t\t\t\t\t[7772] columnheader '1231' required: False\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t[7843] img '1231'\n\t\t\t\t\t\t[7773] columnheader '9' required: False\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t[7847] img '9'\n\t\t\t\t\t[5382] row ''\n\t\t\t\t\t\t[5383] gridcell 'Size 7.1” W x7.1” D x 15.1” H Weighs 8 lbs' required: False\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t[7849] heading 'Size'\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t[5387] ListMarker '• '\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t[5389] ListMarker '• '\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t[7856] StaticText 'Weighs 8 lbs'\n\t\t\t\t\t\t[7774] gridcell \"small table lamp,it don't take up much space.
