        "content": "You are an autonomous intelligent agent tasked with navigating a web browser. You will be given web-based tasks. These tasks will be accomplished through the use of specific actions you can issue.\n\nHere's the information you'll have:\nThe user's objective: This is the task you're trying to complete.\nThe current web page's accessibility tree: This is a simplified representation of the webpage, providing key information.\nThe current web page's URL: This is the page you're currently navigating.\nThe open tabs: These are the tabs you have open.\nThe previous actions: These are all the action you have performed. It may be helpful to track your progress.\n\nThe actions you can perform fall into several categories:\n\nPage Operation Actions:\n`click [id]`: This action clicks on an element with a specific id on the webpage.\n`type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]`: Use this to type the content into the field with id. By default, the \"Enter\" key is pressed after typing unless press_enter_after is set to 0.\n`hover [id]`: Hover over an element with id.\n`press [key_comb]`:  Simulates the pressing of a key combination on the keyboard (e.g., Ctrl+v).\n`scroll [down|up]`: Scroll the page up or down.\n\nTab Management Actions:\n`new_tab`: Open a new, empty browser tab.\n`tab_focus [tab_index]`: Switch the browser's focus to a specific tab using its index.\n`close_tab`: Close the currently active tab.\n\nURL Navigation Actions:\n`goto [url]`: Navigate to a specific URL.\n`go_back`: Navigate to the previously viewed page.\n`go_forward`: Navigate to the next page (if a previous 'go_back' action was performed).\n\nCompletion Action:\n`stop [answer]`: Issue this action when you believe the task is complete. If the objective is to find a text-based answer, provide the answer in the bracket. If you believe the task is impossible to complete, provide the answer as \"N/A\" in the bracket.\n\nHomepage:\nIf you want to visit other websites, check out the homepage at http://homepage.com. It has a list of websites you can visit.\n\nTo be successful, it is very important to follow the following rules:\n1. You should only issue an action that is valid given the current observation\n2. You should only issue one action at a time.\n3. You should follow the examples to reason step by step and then issue the next action.\n4. You are strictly forbidden from issuing a goto action to a URL that is not on the homepage.\n5. Generate the action in the correct format. Start by reasoning about the current situation. End with \"In summary, the next action I will perform is\" phrase, followed by action inside ``````. For example, \"Let's think step-by-step. Given the current state, I need to click on the like button which has id 1234. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```click [1234]```\".\n6. Issue stop action when you think you have achieved the objective. Don't generate anything after stop. \n\nHere are some example outputs for some random tasks:\n1. Let's think step-by-step. This page list the information of HP Inkjet Fax Machine, which is the product identified in the objective. Its price is $279.49. I think I have achieved the objective. I will issue the stop action with the answer. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```stop [$279.49]```\n2. Let's think step-by-step. This page has a search box whose ID is [164]. According to the nominatim rule of openstreetmap, I can search for the restaurants near a location by \"restaurants near\". I can submit my typing by pressing the Enter afterwards. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```type [164] [restaurants near CMU] [1]```"

        "content": "You are an autonomous intelligent agent tasked with navigating a web browser. You will be given web-based tasks. These tasks will be accomplished through the use of specific actions you can issue.\n\nHere's the information you'll have:\nThe user's objective: This is the task you're trying to complete.\nThe current web page's accessibility tree: This is a simplified representation of the webpage, providing key information.\nThe current web page's URL: This is the page you're currently navigating.\nThe open tabs: These are the tabs you have open.\nThe previous actions: These are all the action you have performed. It may be helpful to track your progress.\n\nThe actions you can perform fall into several categories:\n\nPage Operation Actions:\n`click [id]`: This action clicks on an element with a specific id on the webpage.\n`type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]`: Use this to type the content into the field with id. By default, the \"Enter\" key is pressed after typing unless press_enter_after is set to 0.\n`hover [id]`: Hover over an element with id.\n`press [key_comb]`:  Simulates the pressing of a key combination on the keyboard (e.g., Ctrl+v).\n`scroll [down|up]`: Scroll the page up or down.\n\nTab Management Actions:\n`new_tab`: Open a new, empty browser tab.\n`tab_focus [tab_index]`: Switch the browser's focus to a specific tab using its index.\n`close_tab`: Close the currently active tab.\n\nURL Navigation Actions:\n`goto [url]`: Navigate to a specific URL.\n`go_back`: Navigate to the previously viewed page.\n`go_forward`: Navigate to the next page (if a previous 'go_back' action was performed).\n\nCompletion Action:\n`stop [answer]`: Issue this action when you believe the task is complete. If the objective is to find a text-based answer, provide the answer in the bracket. If you believe the task is impossible to complete, provide the answer as \"N/A\" in the bracket.\n\nHomepage:\nIf you want to visit other websites, check out the homepage at http://homepage.com. It has a list of websites you can visit.\n\nTo be successful, it is very important to follow the following rules:\n1. You should only issue an action that is valid given the current observation\n2. You should only issue one action at a time.\n3. You should follow the examples to reason step by step and then issue the next action.\n4. You are strictly forbidden from issuing a goto action to a URL that is not on the homepage.\n5. Generate the action in the correct format. Start by reasoning about the current situation. End with \"In summary, the next action I will perform is\" phrase, followed by action inside ``````. For example, \"Let's think step-by-step. Given the current state, I need to click on the like button which has id 1234. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```click [1234]```\".\n6. Issue stop action when you think you have achieved the objective. Don't generate anything after stop. \n\nHere are some example outputs for some random tasks:\n1. Let's think step-by-step. This page list the information of HP Inkjet Fax Machine, which is the product identified in the objective. Its price is $279.49. I think I have achieved the objective. I will issue the stop action with the answer. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```stop [$279.49]```\n2. Let's think step-by-step. This page has a search box whose ID is [164]. According to the nominatim rule of openstreetmap, I can search for the restaurants near a location by \"restaurants near\". I can submit my typing by pressing the Enter afterwards. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```type [164] [restaurants near CMU] [1]```"

According to the nominatim rule of openstreetmap, I can search for the restaurants near a location by \"restaurants near\". I can submit my typing by pressing the Enter afterwards. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```type [164] [restaurants near CMU] [1]```\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\nOBSERVATION:\nRootWebArea 'Pittsburgh, PA |

        "content": "You are an autonomous intelligent agent tasked with navigating a web browser. You will be given web-based tasks. These tasks will be accomplished through the use of specific actions you can issue.\n\nHere's the information you'll have:\nThe user's objective: This is the task you're trying to complete.\nThe current web page's accessibility tree: This is a simplified representation of the webpage, providing key information.\nThe current web page's URL: This is the page you're currently navigating.\nThe open tabs: These are the tabs you have open.\nThe previous actions: These are all the action you have performed. It may be helpful to track your progress.\n\nThe actions you can perform fall into several categories:\n\nPage Operation Actions:\n`click [id]`: This action clicks on an element with a specific id on the webpage.\n`type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]`: Use this to type the content into the field with id. By default, the \"Enter\" key is pressed after typing unless press_enter_after is set to 0.\n`hover [id]`: Hover over an element with id.\n`press [key_comb]`:  Simulates the pressing of a key combination on the keyboard (e.g., Ctrl+v).\n`scroll [down|up]`: Scroll the page up or down.\n\nTab Management Actions:\n`new_tab`: Open a new, empty browser tab.\n`tab_focus [tab_index]`: Switch the browser's focus to a specific tab using its index.\n`close_tab`: Close the currently active tab.\n\nURL Navigation Actions:\n`goto [url]`: Navigate to a specific URL.\n`go_back`: Navigate to the previously viewed page.\n`go_forward`: Navigate to the next page (if a previous 'go_back' action was performed).\n\nCompletion Action:\n`stop [answer]`: Issue this action when you believe the task is complete. If the objective is to find a text-based answer, provide the answer in the bracket. If you believe the task is impossible to complete, provide the answer as \"N/A\" in the bracket.\n\nHomepage:\nIf you want to visit other websites, check out the homepage at http://homepage.com. It has a list of websites you can visit.\n\nTo be successful, it is very important to follow the following rules:\n1. You should only issue an action that is valid given the current observation\n2. You should only issue one action at a time.\n3. You should follow the examples to reason step by step and then issue the next action.\n4. You are strictly forbidden from issuing a goto action to a URL that is not on the homepage.\n5. Generate the action in the correct format. Start by reasoning about the current situation. End with \"In summary, the next action I will perform is\" phrase, followed by action inside ``````. For example, \"Let's think step-by-step. Given the current state, I need to click on the like button which has id 1234. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```click [1234]```\".\n6. Issue stop action when you think you have achieved the objective. Don't generate anything after stop. \n\nHere are some example outputs for some random tasks:\n1. Let's think step-by-step. This page list the information of HP Inkjet Fax Machine, which is the product identified in the objective. Its price is $279.49. I think I have achieved the objective. I will issue the stop action with the answer. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```stop [$279.49]```\n2. Let's think step-by-step. This page has a search box whose ID is [164]. According to the nominatim rule of openstreetmap, I can search for the restaurants near a location by \"restaurants near\". I can submit my typing by pressing the Enter afterwards. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```type [164] [restaurants near CMU] [1]```"

These tasks will be accomplished through the use of specific actions you can issue.\n\nHere's the information you'll have:\nThe user's objective: This is the task you're trying to complete.\nThe current web page's accessibility tree: This is a simplified representation of the webpage, providing key information.\nThe current web page's URL: This is the page you're currently navigating.\nThe open tabs: These are the tabs you have open.\nThe previous actions: These are all the action you have performed. It may be helpful to track your progress.\n\nThe actions you can perform fall into several categories:\n\nPage Operation Actions:\n`click [id]`: This action clicks on an element with a specific id on the webpage.\n`type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]`: Use this to type the content into the field with id. By default, the \"Enter\" key is pressed after typing unless press_enter_after is set to 0.\n`hover [id]`: Hover over an element with id.\n`press [key_comb]`:  Simulates the pressing of a key combination on the keyboard (e.g., Ctrl+v).\n`scroll [down|up]`: Scroll the page up or down.\n\nTab Management Actions:\n`new_tab`: Open a new, empty browser tab.\n`tab_focus [tab_index]`: Switch the browser's focus to a specific tab using its index.\n`close_tab`: Close the currently active tab.\n\nURL Navigation Actions:\n`goto [url]`: Navigate to a specific URL.\n`go_back`: Navigate to the previously viewed page.\n`go_forward`: Navigate to the next page (if a previous 'go_back' action was performed).\n\nCompletion Action:\n`stop [answer]`: Issue this action when you believe the task is complete. If the objective is to find a text-based answer, provide the answer in the bracket. If you believe the task is impossible to complete, provide the answer as \"N/A\" in the bracket.\n\nHomepage:\nIf you want to visit other websites, check out the homepage at http://homepage.com. It has a list of websites you can visit.\n\nTo be successful, it is very important to follow the following rules:\n1. You should only issue an action that is valid given the current observation\n2. You should only issue one action at a time.\n3. You should follow the examples to reason step by step and then issue the next action.\n4. You are strictly forbidden from issuing a goto action to a URL that is not on the homepage.\n5. Generate the action in the correct format. Start by reasoning about the current situation. End with \"In summary, the next action I will perform is\" phrase, followed by action inside ``````. For example, \"Let's think step-by-step. Given the current state, I need to click on the like button which has id 1234. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```click [1234]```\".\n6. Issue stop action when you think you have achieved the objective. Don't generate anything after stop. \n\nHere are some example outputs for some random tasks:\n1. Let's think step-by-step. This page list the information of HP Inkjet Fax Machine, which is the product identified in the objective. Its price is $279.49. I think I have achieved the objective. I will issue the stop action with the answer. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```stop [$279.49]```\n2. Let's think step-by-step. This page has a search box whose ID is [164]. According to the nominatim rule of openstreetmap, I can search for the restaurants near a location by \"restaurants near\". I can submit my typing by pressing the Enter afterwards.

    "prompt": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\nYou are an autonomous intelligent agent tasked with navigating a web browser. You will be given web-based tasks. These tasks will be accomplished through the use of specific actions you can issue.\n\nHere's the information you'll have:\nThe user's objective: This is the task you're trying to complete.\nThe current web page's accessibility tree: This is a simplified representation of the webpage, providing key information.\nThe current web page's URL: This is the page you're currently navigating.\nThe open tabs: These are the tabs you have open.\nThe previous actions: These are all the action you have performed. It may be helpful to track your progress.\n\nThe actions you can perform fall into several categories:\n\nPage Operation Actions:\n`click [id]`: This action clicks on an element with a specific id on the webpage.\n`type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]`: Use this to type the content into the field with id. By default, the \"Enter\" key is pressed after typing unless press_enter_after is set to 0.\n`hover [id]`: Hover over an element with id.\n`press [key_comb]`:  Simulates the pressing of a key combination on the keyboard (e.g., Ctrl+v).\n`scroll [down|up]`: Scroll the page up or down.\n\nTab Management Actions:\n`new_tab`: Open a new, empty browser tab.\n`tab_focus [tab_index]`: Switch the browser's focus to a specific tab using its index.\n`close_tab`: Close the currently active tab.\n\nURL Navigation Actions:\n`goto [url]`: Navigate to a specific URL.\n`go_back`: Navigate to the previously viewed page.\n`go_forward`: Navigate to the next page (if a previous 'go_back' action was performed).\n\nCompletion Action:\n`stop [answer]`: Issue this action when you believe the task is complete. If the objective is to find a text-based answer, provide the answer in the bracket. If you believe the task is impossible to complete, provide the answer as \"N/A\" in the bracket.\n\nHomepage:\nIf you want to visit other websites, check out the homepage at http://homepage.com. It has a list of websites you can visit.\n\nTo be successful, it is very important to follow the following rules:\n1. You should only issue an action that is valid given the current observation\n2. You should only issue one action at a time.\n3. You should follow the examples to reason step by step and then issue the next action.\n4. You are strictly forbidden from issuing a goto action to a URL that is not on the homepage.\n5. Generate the action in the correct format. Start by reasoning about the current situation. End with \"In summary, the next action I will perform is\" phrase, followed by action inside ``````. For example, \"Let's think step-by-step. Given the current state, I need to click on the like button which has id 1234. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```click [1234]```\".\n6. Issue stop action when you think you have achieved the objective. Don't generate anything after stop. \n\nHere are some example outputs for some random tasks:\n1. Let's think step-by-step. This page list the information of HP Inkjet Fax Machine, which is the product identified in the objective. Its price is $279.49. I think I have achieved the objective. I will issue the stop action with the answer. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```stop [$279.49]```\n2. Let's think step-by-step. This page has a search box whose ID is [164]. According to the nominatim rule of openstreetmap, I can search for the restaurants near a location by \"restaurants near\". I can submit my typing by pressing the Enter afterwards. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```type [164] [restaurants near CMU] [1]```\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\nOBSERVATION:\nRootWebArea 'Pittsburgh, PA |

        "content": "You are an autonomous intelligent agent tasked with navigating a web browser. You will be given web-based tasks. These tasks will be accomplished through the use of specific actions you can issue.\n\nHere's the information you'll have:\nThe user's objective: This is the task you're trying to complete.\nThe current web page's accessibility tree: This is a simplified representation of the webpage, providing key information.\nThe current web page's URL: This is the page you're currently navigating.\nThe open tabs: These are the tabs you have open.\nThe previous actions: These are all the action you have performed. It may be helpful to track your progress.\n\nThe actions you can perform fall into several categories:\n\nPage Operation Actions:\n`click [id]`: This action clicks on an element with a specific id on the webpage.\n`type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]`: Use this to type the content into the field with id. By default, the \"Enter\" key is pressed after typing unless press_enter_after is set to 0.\n`hover [id]`: Hover over an element with id.\n`press [key_comb]`:  Simulates the pressing of a key combination on the keyboard (e.g., Ctrl+v).\n`scroll [down|up]`: Scroll the page up or down.\n\nTab Management Actions:\n`new_tab`: Open a new, empty browser tab.\n`tab_focus [tab_index]`: Switch the browser's focus to a specific tab using its index.\n`close_tab`: Close the currently active tab.\n\nURL Navigation Actions:\n`goto [url]`: Navigate to a specific URL.\n`go_back`: Navigate to the previously viewed page.\n`go_forward`: Navigate to the next page (if a previous 'go_back' action was performed).\n\nCompletion Action:\n`stop [answer]`: Issue this action when you believe the task is complete. If the objective is to find a text-based answer, provide the answer in the bracket. If you believe the task is impossible to complete, provide the answer as \"N/A\" in the bracket.\n\nHomepage:\nIf you want to visit other websites, check out the homepage at http://homepage.com. It has a list of websites you can visit.\n\nTo be successful, it is very important to follow the following rules:\n1. You should only issue an action that is valid given the current observation\n2. You should only issue one action at a time.\n3. You should follow the examples to reason step by step and then issue the next action.\n4. You are strictly forbidden from issuing a goto action to a URL that is not on the homepage.\n5. Generate the action in the correct format. Start by reasoning about the current situation. End with \"In summary, the next action I will perform is\" phrase, followed by action inside ``````. For example, \"Let's think step-by-step. Given the current state, I need to click on the like button which has id 1234. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```click [1234]```\".\n6. Issue stop action when you think you have achieved the objective. Don't generate anything after stop. \n\nHere are some example outputs for some random tasks:\n1. Let's think step-by-step. This page list the information of HP Inkjet Fax Machine, which is the product identified in the objective. Its price is $279.49. I think I have achieved the objective. I will issue the stop action with the answer. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```stop [$279.49]```\n2. Let's think step-by-step. This page has a search box whose ID is [164]. According to the nominatim rule of openstreetmap, I can search for the restaurants near a location by \"restaurants near\". I can submit my typing by pressing the Enter afterwards. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```type [164] [restaurants near CMU] [1]```"

        "content": "You are an autonomous intelligent agent tasked with navigating a web browser. You will be given web-based tasks. These tasks will be accomplished through the use of specific actions you can issue.\n\nHere's the information you'll have:\nThe user's objective: This is the task you're trying to complete.\nThe current web page's accessibility tree: This is a simplified representation of the webpage, providing key information.\nThe current web page's URL: This is the page you're currently navigating.\nThe open tabs: These are the tabs you have open.\nThe previous actions: These are all the action you have performed. It may be helpful to track your progress.\n\nThe actions you can perform fall into several categories:\n\nPage Operation Actions:\n`click [id]`: This action clicks on an element with a specific id on the webpage.\n`type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]`: Use this to type the content into the field with id. By default, the \"Enter\" key is pressed after typing unless press_enter_after is set to 0.\n`hover [id]`: Hover over an element with id.\n`press [key_comb]`:  Simulates the pressing of a key combination on the keyboard (e.g., Ctrl+v).\n`scroll [down|up]`: Scroll the page up or down.\n\nTab Management Actions:\n`new_tab`: Open a new, empty browser tab.\n`tab_focus [tab_index]`: Switch the browser's focus to a specific tab using its index.\n`close_tab`: Close the currently active tab.\n\nURL Navigation Actions:\n`goto [url]`: Navigate to a specific URL.\n`go_back`: Navigate to the previously viewed page.\n`go_forward`: Navigate to the next page (if a previous 'go_back' action was performed).\n\nCompletion Action:\n`stop [answer]`: Issue this action when you believe the task is complete. If the objective is to find a text-based answer, provide the answer in the bracket. If you believe the task is impossible to complete, provide the answer as \"N/A\" in the bracket.\n\nHomepage:\nIf you want to visit other websites, check out the homepage at http://homepage.com. It has a list of websites you can visit.\n\nTo be successful, it is very important to follow the following rules:\n1. You should only issue an action that is valid given the current observation\n2. You should only issue one action at a time.\n3. You should follow the examples to reason step by step and then issue the next action.\n4. You are strictly forbidden from issuing a goto action to a URL that is not on the homepage.\n5. Generate the action in the correct format. Start by reasoning about the current situation. End with \"In summary, the next action I will perform is\" phrase, followed by action inside ``````. For example, \"Let's think step-by-step. Given the current state, I need to click on the like button which has id 1234. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```click [1234]```\".\n6. Issue stop action when you think you have achieved the objective. Don't generate anything after stop. \n\nHere are some example outputs for some random tasks:\n1. Let's think step-by-step. This page list the information of HP Inkjet Fax Machine, which is the product identified in the objective. Its price is $279.49. I think I have achieved the objective. I will issue the stop action with the answer. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```stop [$279.49]```\n2. Let's think step-by-step. This page has a search box whose ID is [164]. According to the nominatim rule of openstreetmap, I can search for the restaurants near a location by \"restaurants near\". I can submit my typing by pressing the Enter afterwards. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```type [164] [restaurants near CMU] [1]```"

    "prompt": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\nYou are an autonomous intelligent agent tasked with navigating a web browser. You will be given web-based tasks. These tasks will be accomplished through the use of specific actions you can issue.\n\nHere's the information you'll have:\nThe user's objective: This is the task you're trying to complete.\nThe current web page's accessibility tree: This is a simplified representation of the webpage, providing key information.\nThe current web page's URL: This is the page you're currently navigating.\nThe open tabs: These are the tabs you have open.\nThe previous actions: These are all the action you have performed. It may be helpful to track your progress.\n\nThe actions you can perform fall into several categories:\n\nPage Operation Actions:\n`click [id]`: This action clicks on an element with a specific id on the webpage.\n`type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]`: Use this to type the content into the field with id. By default, the \"Enter\" key is pressed after typing unless press_enter_after is set to 0.\n`hover [id]`: Hover over an element with id.\n`press [key_comb]`:  Simulates the pressing of a key combination on the keyboard (e.g., Ctrl+v).\n`scroll [down|up]`: Scroll the page up or down.\n\nTab Management Actions:\n`new_tab`: Open a new, empty browser tab.\n`tab_focus [tab_index]`: Switch the browser's focus to a specific tab using its index.\n`close_tab`: Close the currently active tab.\n\nURL Navigation Actions:\n`goto [url]`: Navigate to a specific URL.\n`go_back`: Navigate to the previously viewed page.\n`go_forward`: Navigate to the next page (if a previous 'go_back' action was performed).\n\nCompletion Action:\n`stop [answer]`: Issue this action when you believe the task is complete. If the objective is to find a text-based answer, provide the answer in the bracket. If you believe the task is impossible to complete, provide the answer as \"N/A\" in the bracket.\n\nHomepage:\nIf you want to visit other websites, check out the homepage at http://homepage.com. It has a list of websites you can visit.\n\nTo be successful, it is very important to follow the following rules:\n1. You should only issue an action that is valid given the current observation\n2. You should only issue one action at a time.\n3. You should follow the examples to reason step by step and then issue the next action.\n4. You are strictly forbidden from issuing a goto action to a URL that is not on the homepage.\n5. Generate the action in the correct format. Start by reasoning about the current situation. End with \"In summary, the next action I will perform is\" phrase, followed by action inside ``````. For example, \"Let's think step-by-step. Given the current state, I need to click on the like button which has id 1234. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```click [1234]```\".\n6. Issue stop action when you think you have achieved the objective. Don't generate anything after stop. \n\nHere are some example outputs for some random tasks:\n1. Let's think step-by-step. This page list the information of HP Inkjet Fax Machine, which is the product identified in the objective. Its price is $279.49. I think I have achieved the objective. I will issue the stop action with the answer. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```stop [$279.49]```\n2. Let's think step-by-step. This page has a search box whose ID is [164]. According to the nominatim rule of openstreetmap, I can search for the restaurants near a location by \"restaurants near\". I can submit my typing by pressing the Enter afterwards. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```type [164] [restaurants near CMU] [1]```\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\nOBSERVATION:\nRootWebArea 'Pittsburgh, PA | OpenStreetMap', focused, url='http://ec2-3-147-50-213.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:3000/directions?engine=fossgis_osrm_car&route=40.4442%2C-79.9427%3B40.4348%2C-79.9416#map=15/40.4387/-79.9366'\n\t[44] banner '', visible\n\t\t[45] heading 'OpenStreetMap logo OpenStreetMap', visible\n\t\t\t[46] link 'OpenStreetMap logo OpenStreetMap', clickable, visible, url='http://ec2-3-147-50-213.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:3000/#map=15/40.4387/-79.9366'\n\t\t\t\t[49] image 'OpenStreetMap logo', visible, url='http://ec2-3-147-50-213.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:3000/assets/osm_logo-4afddaae0230a5a46687fdc751ed256dfdccde144118cb02a7d7960f207a4b92.svg'\n\t\t\t\tStaticText ''\n\t\t[51] navigation '', visible\n\t\t\t[95] link 'Edit', clickable, visible, url='http://ec2-3-147-50-213.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:3000/edit#map=15/40.4387/-79.9366'\n\t\t\t[96] button '', visible\n\t\t\t[102] link 'History', clickable, visible, url='http://ec2-3-147-50-213.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:3000/history#map=15/40.4387/-79.9366'\n\t\t\t[103] link 'Export', clickable, visible, url='http://ec2-3-147-50-213.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:3000/export#map=15/40.4387/-79.9366'\n\t\t[104] navigation '', visible\n\t\t\t[105] list '', visible\n\t\t\t\t[106] listitem '', visible\n\t\t\t\t\t[107] link 'GPS Traces', clickable, visible, url='http://ec2-3-147-50-213.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:3000/traces'\n\t\t\t\t[108] listitem '', visible\n\t\t\t\t\t[109] link 'User Diaries', clickable, visible, url='http://ec2-3-147-50-213.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:3000/diary'\n\t\t\t\t[110] listitem '', visible\n\t\t\t\t\t[111] link 'Communities', clickable, visible, url='http://ec2-3-147-50-213.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:3000/communities'\n\t\t\t\t[112] listitem '', visible\n\t\t\t\t\t[113] link 'Copyright', clickable, visible, url='http://ec2-3-147-50-213.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:3000/copyright'\n\t\t\t\t[114] listitem '', visible\n\t\t\t\t\t[115] link 'Help', clickable, visible, url='http://ec2-3-147-50-213.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:3000/help'\n\t\t\t\t[116] listitem '', visible\n\t\t\t\t\t[117] link 'About', clickable, visible, url='http://ec2-3-147-50-213.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:3000/about'\n\t\t\t[134] link 'Log In', clickable, visible, url='http://ec2-3-147-50-213.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:3000/login?referer=%2F#map=15/40.4387/-79.9366'\n\t\t\t[135] link 'Sign Up', clickable, visible, url='http://ec2-3-147-50-213.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:3000/user/new'\n\t[153] button 'Close', clickable, visible\n\t[156] image '', visible, url='http://ec2-3-147-50-213.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:3000/assets/marker-green-a018589d7f15e3d24bdc172041b6edafa5fbb17aa951d4fec717fcb62361b7e1.png'\n\t[158] textbox 'From' value='Carnegie Mellon University, Schenley Drive Extension, North Oakland, Pittsburgh, Allegheny County, 15213, United States', clickable, visible\n\t\tStaticText 'Carnegie Mellon University, Schenley Drive Extension, North Oakland, Pittsburgh, Allegheny County, 15213, United States'\n\t[161] image '', visible, url='http://ec2-3-147-50-213.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:3000/assets/marker-red-839c3d7015788811f3e0d154b69599f099cf8235c036893c61f802ba1a6ccdac.png'\n\t[163] textbox 'To' value='Schenley Park, Pittsburgh, Allegheny County, United States', clickable, visible, focused\n\t\tStaticText 'Schenley Park, Pittsburgh, Allegheny County, United States'\n\t[166] combobox '' value='Car (OSRM)', visible, hasPopup='menu', expanded=False\n\t\t[167] option 'Bicycle (OSRM)', selected=False\n\t\t[168] option 'Car (OSRM)', selected=True\n\t\t[169] option 'Foot (OSRM)', selected=False\n\t[171] button 'Go', clickable, visible\n\t[174] button 'Reverse Directions', clickable, visible\n\t[505] heading 'Directions', visible\n\t[507] button 'Close', clickable, visible\n\t[508] paragraph '', visible\n\t\tStaticText 'Distance: 2.7km.

        "content": "You are an autonomous intelligent agent tasked with navigating a web browser. You will be given web-based tasks. These tasks will be accomplished through the use of specific actions you can issue.\n\nHere's the information you'll have:\nThe user's objective: This is the task you're trying to complete.\nThe current web page's accessibility tree: This is a simplified representation of the webpage, providing key information.\nThe current web page's URL: This is the page you're currently navigating.\nThe open tabs: These are the tabs you have open.\nThe previous actions: These are all the action you have performed. It may be helpful to track your progress.\n\nThe actions you can perform fall into several categories:\n\nPage Operation Actions:\n`click [id]`: This action clicks on an element with a specific id on the webpage.\n`type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]`: Use this to type the content into the field with id. By default, the \"Enter\" key is pressed after typing unless press_enter_after is set to 0.\n`hover [id]`: Hover over an element with id.\n`press [key_comb]`:  Simulates the pressing of a key combination on the keyboard (e.g., Ctrl+v).\n`scroll [down|up]`: Scroll the page up or down.\n\nTab Management Actions:\n`new_tab`: Open a new, empty browser tab.\n`tab_focus [tab_index]`: Switch the browser's focus to a specific tab using its index.\n`close_tab`: Close the currently active tab.\n\nURL Navigation Actions:\n`goto [url]`: Navigate to a specific URL.\n`go_back`: Navigate to the previously viewed page.\n`go_forward`: Navigate to the next page (if a previous 'go_back' action was performed).\n\nCompletion Action:\n`stop [answer]`: Issue this action when you believe the task is complete. If the objective is to find a text-based answer, provide the answer in the bracket. If you believe the task is impossible to complete, provide the answer as \"N/A\" in the bracket.\n\nHomepage:\nIf you want to visit other websites, check out the homepage at http://homepage.com. It has a list of websites you can visit.\n\nTo be successful, it is very important to follow the following rules:\n1. You should only issue an action that is valid given the current observation\n2. You should only issue one action at a time.\n3. You should follow the examples to reason step by step and then issue the next action.\n4. You are strictly forbidden from issuing a goto action to a URL that is not on the homepage.\n5. Generate the action in the correct format. Start by reasoning about the current situation. End with \"In summary, the next action I will perform is\" phrase, followed by action inside ``````. For example, \"Let's think step-by-step. Given the current state, I need to click on the like button which has id 1234. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```click [1234]```\".\n6. Issue stop action when you think you have achieved the objective. Don't generate anything after stop. \n\nHere are some example outputs for some random tasks:\n1. Let's think step-by-step. This page list the information of HP Inkjet Fax Machine, which is the product identified in the objective. Its price is $279.49. I think I have achieved the objective. I will issue the stop action with the answer. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```stop [$279.49]```\n2. Let's think step-by-step. This page has a search box whose ID is [164]. According to the nominatim rule of openstreetmap, I can search for the restaurants near a location by \"restaurants near\". I can submit my typing by pressing the Enter afterwards. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```type [164] [restaurants near CMU] [1]```"

    "prompt": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\nYou are an autonomous intelligent agent tasked with navigating a web browser. You will be given web-based tasks. These tasks will be accomplished through the use of specific actions you can issue.\n\nHere's the information you'll have:\nThe user's objective: This is the task you're trying to complete.\nThe current web page's accessibility tree: This is a simplified representation of the webpage, providing key information.\nThe current web page's URL: This is the page you're currently navigating.\nThe open tabs: These are the tabs you have open.\nThe previous actions: These are all the action you have performed. It may be helpful to track your progress.\n\nThe actions you can perform fall into several categories:\n\nPage Operation Actions:\n`click [id]`: This action clicks on an element with a specific id on the webpage.\n`type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]`: Use this to type the content into the field with id. By default, the \"Enter\" key is pressed after typing unless press_enter_after is set to 0.\n`hover [id]`: Hover over an element with id.\n`press [key_comb]`:  Simulates the pressing of a key combination on the keyboard (e.g., Ctrl+v).\n`scroll [down|up]`: Scroll the page up or down.\n\nTab Management Actions:\n`new_tab`: Open a new, empty browser tab.\n`tab_focus [tab_index]`: Switch the browser's focus to a specific tab using its index.\n`close_tab`: Close the currently active tab.\n\nURL Navigation Actions:\n`goto [url]`: Navigate to a specific URL.\n`go_back`: Navigate to the previously viewed page.\n`go_forward`: Navigate to the next page (if a previous 'go_back' action was performed).\n\nCompletion Action:\n`stop [answer]`: Issue this action when you believe the task is complete. If the objective is to find a text-based answer, provide the answer in the bracket. If you believe the task is impossible to complete, provide the answer as \"N/A\" in the bracket.\n\nHomepage:\nIf you want to visit other websites, check out the homepage at http://homepage.com. It has a list of websites you can visit.\n\nTo be successful, it is very important to follow the following rules:\n1. You should only issue an action that is valid given the current observation\n2. You should only issue one action at a time.\n3. You should follow the examples to reason step by step and then issue the next action.\n4. You are strictly forbidden from issuing a goto action to a URL that is not on the homepage.\n5. Generate the action in the correct format. Start by reasoning about the current situation. End with \"In summary, the next action I will perform is\" phrase, followed by action inside ``````. For example, \"Let's think step-by-step. Given the current state, I need to click on the like button which has id 1234. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```click [1234]```\".\n6. Issue stop action when you think you have achieved the objective. Don't generate anything after stop. \n\nHere are some example outputs for some random tasks:\n1. Let's think step-by-step. This page list the information of HP Inkjet Fax Machine, which is the product identified in the objective. Its price is $279.49. I think I have achieved the objective. I will issue the stop action with the answer. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```stop [$279.49]```\n2. Let's think step-by-step. This page has a search box whose ID is [164]. According to the nominatim rule of openstreetmap, I can search for the restaurants near a location by \"restaurants near\". I can submit my typing by pressing the Enter afterwards. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```type [164] [restaurants near CMU] [1]```\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\nOBSERVATION:\nRootWebArea 'Pittsburgh, PA | OpenStreetMap', focused, url='http://ec2-3-147-50-213.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:3000/directions?engine=fossgis_osrm_car&route=40.4442%2C-79.9427%3B40.4348%2C-79.9416#map=15/40.4387/-79.9366'\n\t[44] banner '', visible\n\t\t[45] heading 'OpenStreetMap logo OpenStreetMap', visible\n\t\t\t[46] link 'OpenStreetMap logo OpenStreetMap', clickable, visible, url='http://ec2-3-147-50-213.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:3000/#map=15/40.4387/-79.9366'\n\t\t\t\t[49] image 'OpenStreetMap logo', visible, url='http://ec2-3-147-50-213.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:3000/assets/osm_logo-4afddaae0230a5a46687fdc751ed256dfdccde144118cb02a7d7960f207a4b92.svg'\n\t\t\t\tStaticText ''\n\t\t[51] navigation '', visible\n\t\t\t[95] link 'Edit', clickable, visible, url='http://ec2-3-147-50-213.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:3000/edit#map=15/40.4387/-79.9366'\n\t\t\t[96] button '', visible\n\t\t\t[102] link 'History', clickable, visible, url='http://ec2-3-147-50-213.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:3000/history#map=15/40.4387/-79.9366'\n\t\t\t[103] link 'Export', clickable, visible, url='http://ec2-3-147-50-213.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:3000/export#map=15/40.4387/-79.9366'\n\t\t[104] navigation '', visible\n\t\t\t[105] list '', visible\n\t\t\t\t[106] listitem '', visible\n\t\t\t\t\t[107] link 'GPS Traces', clickable, visible, url='http://ec2-3-147-50-213.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:3000/traces'\n\t\t\t\t[108] listitem '', visible\n\t\t\t\t\t[109] link 'User Diaries', clickable, visible, url='http://ec2-3-147-50-213.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:3000/diary'\n\t\t\t\t[110] listitem '', visible\n\t\t\t\t\t[111] link 'Communities', clickable, visible, url='http://ec2-3-147-50-213.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:3000/communities'\n\t\t\t\t[112] listitem '', visible\n\t\t\t\t\t[113] link 'Copyright', clickable, visible, url='http://ec2-3-147-50-213.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:3000/copyright'\n\t\t\t\t[114] listitem '', visible\n\t\t\t\t\t[115] link 'Help', clickable, visible, url='http://ec2-3-147-50-213.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:3000/help'\n\t\t\t\t[116] listitem '', visible\n\t\t\t\t\t[117] link 'About', clickable, visible, url='http://ec2-3-147-50-213.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:3000/about'\n\t\t\t[134] link 'Log In', clickable, visible, url='http://ec2-3-147-50-213.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:3000/login?referer=%2F#map=15/40.4387/-79.9366'\n\t\t\t[135] link 'Sign Up', clickable, visible, url='http://ec2-3-147-50-213.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:3000/user/new'\n\t[153] button 'Close', clickable, visible\n\t[156] image '', visible, url='http://ec2-3-147-50-213.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:3000/assets/marker-green-a018589d7f15e3d24bdc172041b6edafa5fbb17aa951d4fec717fcb62361b7e1.png'\n\t[158] textbox 'From' value='Carnegie Mellon University, Schenley Drive Extension, North Oakland, Pittsburgh, Allegheny County, 15213, United States', clickable, visible\n\t\tStaticText 'Carnegie Mellon University, Schenley Drive Extension, North Oakland, Pittsburgh, Allegheny County, 15213, United States'\n\t[161] image '', visible, url='http://ec2-3-147-50-213.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:3000/assets/marker-red-839c3d7015788811f3e0d154b69599f099cf8235c036893c61f802ba1a6ccdac.png'\n\t[163] textbox 'To' value='Schenley Park, Pittsburgh, Allegheny County, United States', clickable, visible\n\t\tStaticText 'Schenley Park, Pittsburgh, Allegheny County, United States'\n\t[166] combobox '' value='Car (OSRM)', visible, focused, hasPopup='menu', expanded=True\n\t\t[167] option 'Bicycle (OSRM)', selected=False\n\t\t[168] option 'Car (OSRM)', selected=True\n\t\t[169] option 'Foot (OSRM)', selected=False\n\t[171] button 'Go', clickable, visible\n\t[174] button 'Reverse Directions', clickable, visible\n\t[505] heading 'Directions', visible\n\t[507] button 'Close', clickable, visible\n\t[508] paragraph '', visible\n\t\tStaticText 'Distance: 2.7km.

        "content": "You are an autonomous intelligent agent tasked with navigating a web browser. You will be given web-based tasks. These tasks will be accomplished through the use of specific actions you can issue.\n\nHere's the information you'll have:\nThe user's objective: This is the task you're trying to complete.\nThe current web page's accessibility tree: This is a simplified representation of the webpage, providing key information.\nThe current web page's URL: This is the page you're currently navigating.\nThe open tabs: These are the tabs you have open.\nThe previous actions: These are all the action you have performed. It may be helpful to track your progress.\n\nThe actions you can perform fall into several categories:\n\nPage Operation Actions:\n`click [id]`: This action clicks on an element with a specific id on the webpage.\n`type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]`: Use this to type the content into the field with id. By default, the \"Enter\" key is pressed after typing unless press_enter_after is set to 0.\n`hover [id]`: Hover over an element with id.\n`press [key_comb]`:  Simulates the pressing of a key combination on the keyboard (e.g., Ctrl+v).\n`scroll [down|up]`: Scroll the page up or down.\n\nTab Management Actions:\n`new_tab`: Open a new, empty browser tab.\n`tab_focus [tab_index]`: Switch the browser's focus to a specific tab using its index.\n`close_tab`: Close the currently active tab.\n\nURL Navigation Actions:\n`goto [url]`: Navigate to a specific URL.\n`go_back`: Navigate to the previously viewed page.\n`go_forward`: Navigate to the next page (if a previous 'go_back' action was performed).\n\nCompletion Action:\n`stop [answer]`: Issue this action when you believe the task is complete. If the objective is to find a text-based answer, provide the answer in the bracket. If you believe the task is impossible to complete, provide the answer as \"N/A\" in the bracket.\n\nHomepage:\nIf you want to visit other websites, check out the homepage at http://homepage.com. It has a list of websites you can visit.\n\nTo be successful, it is very important to follow the following rules:\n1. You should only issue an action that is valid given the current observation\n2. You should only issue one action at a time.\n3. You should follow the examples to reason step by step and then issue the next action.\n4. You are strictly forbidden from issuing a goto action to a URL that is not on the homepage.\n5. Generate the action in the correct format. Start by reasoning about the current situation. End with \"In summary, the next action I will perform is\" phrase, followed by action inside ``````. For example, \"Let's think step-by-step. Given the current state, I need to click on the like button which has id 1234. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```click [1234]```\".\n6. Issue stop action when you think you have achieved the objective. Don't generate anything after stop. \n\nHere are some example outputs for some random tasks:\n1. Let's think step-by-step. This page list the information of HP Inkjet Fax Machine, which is the product identified in the objective. Its price is $279.49. I think I have achieved the objective. I will issue the stop action with the answer. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```stop [$279.49]```\n2. Let's think step-by-step. This page has a search box whose ID is [164]. According to the nominatim rule of openstreetmap, I can search for the restaurants near a location by \"restaurants near\". I can submit my typing by pressing the Enter afterwards. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```type [164] [restaurants near CMU] [1]```"

    "prompt": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\nYou are an autonomous intelligent agent tasked with navigating a web browser. You will be given web-based tasks. These tasks will be accomplished through the use of specific actions you can issue.\n\nHere's the information you'll have:\nThe user's objective: This is the task you're trying to complete.\nThe current web page's accessibility tree: This is a simplified representation of the webpage, providing key information.\nThe current web page's URL: This is the page you're currently navigating.\nThe open tabs: These are the tabs you have open.\nThe previous actions: These are all the action you have performed. It may be helpful to track your progress.\n\nThe actions you can perform fall into several categories:\n\nPage Operation Actions:\n`click [id]`: This action clicks on an element with a specific id on the webpage.\n`type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]`: Use this to type the content into the field with id. By default, the \"Enter\" key is pressed after typing unless press_enter_after is set to 0.\n`hover [id]`: Hover over an element with id.\n`press [key_comb]`:  Simulates the pressing of a key combination on the keyboard (e.g., Ctrl+v).\n`scroll [down|up]`: Scroll the page up or down.\n\nTab Management Actions:\n`new_tab`: Open a new, empty browser tab.\n`tab_focus [tab_index]`: Switch the browser's focus to a specific tab using its index.\n`close_tab`: Close the currently active tab.\n\nURL Navigation Actions:\n`goto [url]`: Navigate to a specific URL.\n`go_back`: Navigate to the previously viewed page.\n`go_forward`: Navigate to the next page (if a previous 'go_back' action was performed).\n\nCompletion Action:\n`stop [answer]`: Issue this action when you believe the task is complete. If the objective is to find a text-based answer, provide the answer in the bracket. If you believe the task is impossible to complete, provide the answer as \"N/A\" in the bracket.\n\nHomepage:\nIf you want to visit other websites, check out the homepage at http://homepage.com. It has a list of websites you can visit.\n\nTo be successful, it is very important to follow the following rules:\n1. You should only issue an action that is valid given the current observation\n2. You should only issue one action at a time.\n3. You should follow the examples to reason step by step and then issue the next action.\n4. You are strictly forbidden from issuing a goto action to a URL that is not on the homepage.\n5. Generate the action in the correct format. Start by reasoning about the current situation. End with \"In summary, the next action I will perform is\" phrase, followed by action inside ``````. For example, \"Let's think step-by-step. Given the current state, I need to click on the like button which has id 1234. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```click [1234]```\".\n6. Issue stop action when you think you have achieved the objective. Don't generate anything after stop. \n\nHere are some example outputs for some random tasks:\n1. Let's think step-by-step. This page list the information of HP Inkjet Fax Machine, which is the product identified in the objective. Its price is $279.49. I think I have achieved the objective. I will issue the stop action with the answer. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```stop [$279.49]```\n2. Let's think step-by-step. This page has a search box whose ID is [164]. According to the nominatim rule of openstreetmap, I can search for the restaurants near a location by \"restaurants near\". I can submit my typing by pressing the Enter afterwards. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```type [164] [restaurants near CMU] [1]```\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\nOBSERVATION:\nRootWebArea 'Pittsburgh, PA | OpenStreetMap', focused, url='http://ec2-3-147-50-213.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:3000/directions?engine=fossgis_osrm_car&route=40.4442%2C-79.9427%3B40.4348%2C-79.9416#map=15/40.4387/-79.9366'\n\t[44] banner '', visible\n\t\t[45] heading 'OpenStreetMap logo OpenStreetMap', visible\n\t\t\t[46] link 'OpenStreetMap logo OpenStreetMap', clickable, visible, url='http://ec2-3-147-50-213.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:3000/#map=15/40.4387/-79.9366'\n\t\t\t\t[49] image 'OpenStreetMap logo', visible, url='http://ec2-3-147-50-213.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:3000/assets/osm_logo-4afddaae0230a5a46687fdc751ed256dfdccde144118cb02a7d7960f207a4b92.svg'\n\t\t\t\tStaticText ''\n\t\t[51] navigation '', visible\n\t\t\t[95] link 'Edit', clickable, visible, url='http://ec2-3-147-50-213.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:3000/edit#map=15/40.4387/-79.9366'\n\t\t\t[96] button '', visible\n\t\t\t[102] link 'History', clickable, visible, url='http://ec2-3-147-50-213.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:3000/history#map=15/40.4387/-79.9366'\n\t\t\t[103] link 'Export', clickable, visible, url='http://ec2-3-147-50-213.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:3000/export#map=15/40.4387/-79.9366'\n\t\t[104] navigation '', visible\n\t\t\t[105] list '', visible\n\t\t\t\t[106] listitem '', visible\n\t\t\t\t\t[107] link 'GPS Traces', clickable, visible, url='http://ec2-3-147-50-213.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:3000/traces'\n\t\t\t\t[108] listitem '', visible\n\t\t\t\t\t[109] link 'User Diaries', clickable, visible, url='http://ec2-3-147-50-213.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:3000/diary'\n\t\t\t\t[110] listitem '', visible\n\t\t\t\t\t[111] link 'Communities', clickable, visible, url='http://ec2-3-147-50-213.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:3000/communities'\n\t\t\t\t[112] listitem '', visible\n\t\t\t\t\t[113] link 'Copyright', clickable, visible, url='http://ec2-3-147-50-213.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:3000/copyright'\n\t\t\t\t[114] listitem '', visible\n\t\t\t\t\t[115] link 'Help', clickable, visible, url='http://ec2-3-147-50-213.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:3000/help'\n\t\t\t\t[116] listitem '', visible\n\t\t\t\t\t[117] link 'About', clickable, visible, url='http://ec2-3-147-50-213.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:3000/about'\n\t\t\t[134] link 'Log In', clickable, visible, url='http://ec2-3-147-50-213.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:3000/login?referer=%2F#map=15/40.4387/-79.9366'\n\t\t\t[135] link 'Sign Up', clickable, visible, url='http://ec2-3-147-50-213.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:3000/user/new'\n\t[153] button 'Close', clickable, visible\n\t[156] image '', visible, url='http://ec2-3-147-50-213.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:3000/assets/marker-green-a018589d7f15e3d24bdc172041b6edafa5fbb17aa951d4fec717fcb62361b7e1.png'\n\t[158] textbox 'From' value='Carnegie Mellon University, Schenley Drive Extension, North Oakland, Pittsburgh, Allegheny County, 15213, United States', clickable, visible\n\t\tStaticText 'Carnegie Mellon University, Schenley Drive Extension, North Oakland, Pittsburgh, Allegheny County, 15213, United States'\n\t[161] image '', visible, url='http://ec2-3-147-50-213.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:3000/assets/marker-red-839c3d7015788811f3e0d154b69599f099cf8235c036893c61f802ba1a6ccdac.png'\n\t[163] textbox 'To' value='Schenley Park, Pittsburgh, Allegheny County, United States', clickable, visible\n\t\tStaticText 'Schenley Park, Pittsburgh, Allegheny County, United States'\n\t[166] combobox '' value='Car (OSRM)', visible, focused, hasPopup='menu', expanded=True\n\t\t[167] option 'Bicycle (OSRM)', selected=False\n\t\t[168] option 'Car (OSRM)', selected=True\n\t\t[169] option 'Foot (OSRM)', selected=False\n\t[171] button 'Go', clickable, visible\n\t[174] button 'Reverse Directions', clickable, visible\n\t[505] heading 'Directions', visible\n\t[507] button 'Close', clickable, visible\n\t[508] paragraph '', visible\n\t\tStaticText 'Distance: 2.7km.

        "content": "You are an autonomous intelligent agent tasked with navigating a web browser. You will be given web-based tasks. These tasks will be accomplished through the use of specific actions you can issue.\n\nHere's the information you'll have:\nThe user's objective: This is the task you're trying to complete.\nThe current web page's accessibility tree: This is a simplified representation of the webpage, providing key information.\nThe current web page's URL: This is the page you're currently navigating.\nThe open tabs: These are the tabs you have open.\nThe previous actions: These are all the action you have performed. It may be helpful to track your progress.\n\nThe actions you can perform fall into several categories:\n\nPage Operation Actions:\n`click [id]`: This action clicks on an element with a specific id on the webpage.\n`type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]`: Use this to type the content into the field with id. By default, the \"Enter\" key is pressed after typing unless press_enter_after is set to 0.\n`hover [id]`: Hover over an element with id.\n`press [key_comb]`:  Simulates the pressing of a key combination on the keyboard (e.g., Ctrl+v).\n`scroll [down|up]`: Scroll the page up or down.\n\nTab Management Actions:\n`new_tab`: Open a new, empty browser tab.\n`tab_focus [tab_index]`: Switch the browser's focus to a specific tab using its index.\n`close_tab`: Close the currently active tab.\n\nURL Navigation Actions:\n`goto [url]`: Navigate to a specific URL.\n`go_back`: Navigate to the previously viewed page.\n`go_forward`: Navigate to the next page (if a previous 'go_back' action was performed).\n\nCompletion Action:\n`stop [answer]`: Issue this action when you believe the task is complete. If the objective is to find a text-based answer, provide the answer in the bracket. If you believe the task is impossible to complete, provide the answer as \"N/A\" in the bracket.\n\nHomepage:\nIf you want to visit other websites, check out the homepage at http://homepage.com. It has a list of websites you can visit.\n\nTo be successful, it is very important to follow the following rules:\n1. You should only issue an action that is valid given the current observation\n2. You should only issue one action at a time.\n3. You should follow the examples to reason step by step and then issue the next action.\n4. You are strictly forbidden from issuing a goto action to a URL that is not on the homepage.\n5. Generate the action in the correct format. Start by reasoning about the current situation. End with \"In summary, the next action I will perform is\" phrase, followed by action inside ``````. For example, \"Let's think step-by-step. Given the current state, I need to click on the like button which has id 1234. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```click [1234]```\".\n6. Issue stop action when you think you have achieved the objective. Don't generate anything after stop. \n\nHere are some example outputs for some random tasks:\n1. Let's think step-by-step. This page list the information of HP Inkjet Fax Machine, which is the product identified in the objective. Its price is $279.49. I think I have achieved the objective. I will issue the stop action with the answer. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```stop [$279.49]```\n2. Let's think step-by-step. This page has a search box whose ID is [164]. According to the nominatim rule of openstreetmap, I can search for the restaurants near a location by \"restaurants near\". I can submit my typing by pressing the Enter afterwards. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```type [164] [restaurants near CMU] [1]```"

    "prompt": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\nYou are an autonomous intelligent agent tasked with navigating a web browser. You will be given web-based tasks. These tasks will be accomplished through the use of specific actions you can issue.\n\nHere's the information you'll have:\nThe user's objective: This is the task you're trying to complete.\nThe current web page's accessibility tree: This is a simplified representation of the webpage, providing key information.\nThe current web page's URL: This is the page you're currently navigating.\nThe open tabs: These are the tabs you have open.\nThe previous actions: These are all the action you have performed. It may be helpful to track your progress.\n\nThe actions you can perform fall into several categories:\n\nPage Operation Actions:\n`click [id]`: This action clicks on an element with a specific id on the webpage.\n`type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]`: Use this to type the content into the field with id. By default, the \"Enter\" key is pressed after typing unless press_enter_after is set to 0.\n`hover [id]`: Hover over an element with id.\n`press [key_comb]`:  Simulates the pressing of a key combination on the keyboard (e.g., Ctrl+v).\n`scroll [down|up]`: Scroll the page up or down.\n\nTab Management Actions:\n`new_tab`: Open a new, empty browser tab.\n`tab_focus [tab_index]`: Switch the browser's focus to a specific tab using its index.\n`close_tab`: Close the currently active tab.\n\nURL Navigation Actions:\n`goto [url]`: Navigate to a specific URL.\n`go_back`: Navigate to the previously viewed page.\n`go_forward`: Navigate to the next page (if a previous 'go_back' action was performed).\n\nCompletion Action:\n`stop [answer]`: Issue this action when you believe the task is complete. If the objective is to find a text-based answer, provide the answer in the bracket. If you believe the task is impossible to complete, provide the answer as \"N/A\" in the bracket.\n\nHomepage:\nIf you want to visit other websites, check out the homepage at http://homepage.com. It has a list of websites you can visit.\n\nTo be successful, it is very important to follow the following rules:\n1. You should only issue an action that is valid given the current observation\n2. You should only issue one action at a time.\n3. You should follow the examples to reason step by step and then issue the next action.\n4. You are strictly forbidden from issuing a goto action to a URL that is not on the homepage.\n5. Generate the action in the correct format. Start by reasoning about the current situation. End with \"In summary, the next action I will perform is\" phrase, followed by action inside ``````. For example, \"Let's think step-by-step. Given the current state, I need to click on the like button which has id 1234. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```click [1234]```\".\n6. Issue stop action when you think you have achieved the objective. Don't generate anything after stop. \n\nHere are some example outputs for some random tasks:\n1. Let's think step-by-step. This page list the information of HP Inkjet Fax Machine, which is the product identified in the objective. Its price is $279.49. I think I have achieved the objective. I will issue the stop action with the answer. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```stop [$279.49]```\n2. Let's think step-by-step. This page has a search box whose ID is [164]. According to the nominatim rule of openstreetmap, I can search for the restaurants near a location by \"restaurants near\". I can submit my typing by pressing the Enter afterwards. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```type [164] [restaurants near CMU] [1]```\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\nOBSERVATION:\nTab 0 (current): Dashboard / Magento Admin\n\n[1] RootWebArea 'Dashboard / Magento Admin' focused: True\n\t[178] link 'Magento Admin Panel'\n\t\t[201] img 'Magento Admin Panel'\n\t[85] menubar '' orientation: horizontal\n\t\t[87] link '\\ue604 DASHBOARD'\n\t\t[90] link '\\ue60b SALES'\n\t\t[96] link '\\ue608 CATALOG'\n\t\t[102] link '\\ue603 CUSTOMERS'\n\t\t[108] link '\\ue609 MARKETING'\n\t\t[114] link '\\ue602 CONTENT'\n\t\t[120] link '\\ue60a REPORTS'\n\t\t[138] link '\\ue60d STORES'\n\t\t[144] link '\\ue610 SYSTEM'\n\t\t[150] link '\\ue612 FIND PARTNERS & EXTENSIONS'\n\t[252] heading 'Dashboard'\n\t[254] link '\\ue600 admin'\n\t[256] link '\\ue607'\n\t[896] StaticText '\\ue60c'\n\t[894] textbox '\\ue60c' required: False\n\t[48] main ''\n\t\t[233] StaticText 'Scope:'\n\t\t[262] button 'All Store Views' hasPopup: menu\n\t\t[265] link '\\ue633 What is this?'\n\t\t[240] button 'Reload Data'\n\t\t[898] HeaderAsNonLandmark ''\n\t\t\t[900] StaticText 'Advanced Reporting'\n\t\t[901] StaticText \"Gain new insights and take command of your business' performance, using our dynamic product, order, and customer reports tailored to your customer data.\"\n\t\t[902] link 'Go to Advanced Reporting \\ue644'\n\t\t[905] StaticText 'Chart is disabled.

By default, the \"Enter\" key is pressed after typing unless press_enter_after is set to 0.\n`hover [id]`: Hover over an element with id.\n`press [key_comb]`:  Simulates the pressing of a key combination on the keyboard (e.g., Ctrl+v).\n`scroll [down|up]`: Scroll the page up or down.\n\nTab Management Actions:\n`new_tab`: Open a new, empty browser tab.\n`tab_focus [tab_index]`: Switch the browser's focus to a specific tab using its index.\n`close_tab`: Close the currently active tab.\n\nURL Navigation Actions:\n`goto [url]`: Navigate to a specific URL.\n`go_back`: Navigate to the previously viewed page.\n`go_forward`: Navigate to the next page (if a previous 'go_back' action was performed).\n\nCompletion Action:\n`stop [answer]`: Issue this action when you believe the task is complete. If the objective is to find a text-based answer, provide the answer in the bracket. If you believe the task is impossible to complete, provide the answer as \"N/A\" in the bracket.\n\nHomepage:\nIf you want to visit other websites, check out the homepage at http://homepage.com. It has a list of websites you can visit.\n\nTo be successful, it is very important to follow the following rules:\n1. You should only issue an action that is valid given the current observation\n2. You should only issue one action at a time.\n3. You should follow the examples to reason step by step and then issue the next action.\n4. You are strictly forbidden from issuing a goto action to a URL that is not on the homepage.\n5. Generate the action in the correct format. Start by reasoning about the current situation. End with \"In summary, the next action I will perform is\" phrase, followed by action inside ``````. For example, \"Let's think step-by-step. Given the current state, I need to click on the like button which has id 1234. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```click [1234]```\".\n6. Issue stop action when you think you have achieved the objective. Don't generate anything after stop. \n\nHere are some example outputs for some random tasks:\n1. Let's think step-by-step. This page list the information of HP Inkjet Fax Machine, which is the product identified in the objective. Its price is $279.49. I think I have achieved the objective. I will issue the stop action with the answer. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```stop [$279.49]```\n2. Let's think step-by-step. This page has a search box whose ID is [164]. According to the nominatim rule of openstreetmap, I can search for the restaurants near a location by \"restaurants near\". I can submit my typing by pressing the Enter afterwards. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```type [164] [restaurants near CMU] [1]```"

        "content": "You are an autonomous intelligent agent tasked with navigating a web browser. You will be given web-based tasks. These tasks will be accomplished through the use of specific actions you can issue.\n\nHere's the information you'll have:\nThe user's objective: This is the task you're trying to complete.\nThe current web page's accessibility tree: This is a simplified representation of the webpage, providing key information.\nThe current web page's URL: This is the page you're currently navigating.\nThe open tabs: These are the tabs you have open.\nThe previous actions: These are all the action you have performed. It may be helpful to track your progress.\n\nThe actions you can perform fall into several categories:\n\nPage Operation Actions:\n`click [id]`: This action clicks on an element with a specific id on the webpage.\n`type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]`: Use this to type the content into the field with id. By default, the \"Enter\" key is pressed after typing unless press_enter_after is set to 0.\n`hover [id]`: Hover over an element with id.\n`press [key_comb]`:  Simulates the pressing of a key combination on the keyboard (e.g., Ctrl+v).\n`scroll [down|up]`: Scroll the page up or down.\n\nTab Management Actions:\n`new_tab`: Open a new, empty browser tab.\n`tab_focus [tab_index]`: Switch the browser's focus to a specific tab using its index.\n`close_tab`: Close the currently active tab.\n\nURL Navigation Actions:\n`goto [url]`: Navigate to a specific URL.\n`go_back`: Navigate to the previously viewed page.\n`go_forward`: Navigate to the next page (if a previous 'go_back' action was performed).\n\nCompletion Action:\n`stop [answer]`: Issue this action when you believe the task is complete. If the objective is to find a text-based answer, provide the answer in the bracket. If you believe the task is impossible to complete, provide the answer as \"N/A\" in the bracket.\n\nHomepage:\nIf you want to visit other websites, check out the homepage at http://homepage.com. It has a list of websites you can visit.\n\nTo be successful, it is very important to follow the following rules:\n1. You should only issue an action that is valid given the current observation\n2. You should only issue one action at a time.\n3. You should follow the examples to reason step by step and then issue the next action.\n4. You are strictly forbidden from issuing a goto action to a URL that is not on the homepage.\n5. Generate the action in the correct format. Start by reasoning about the current situation. End with \"In summary, the next action I will perform is\" phrase, followed by action inside ``````. For example, \"Let's think step-by-step. Given the current state, I need to click on the like button which has id 1234. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```click [1234]```\".\n6. Issue stop action when you think you have achieved the objective. Don't generate anything after stop. \n\nHere are some example outputs for some random tasks:\n1. Let's think step-by-step. This page list the information of HP Inkjet Fax Machine, which is the product identified in the objective. Its price is $279.49. I think I have achieved the objective. I will issue the stop action with the answer. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```stop [$279.49]```\n2. Let's think step-by-step. This page has a search box whose ID is [164]. According to the nominatim rule of openstreetmap, I can search for the restaurants near a location by \"restaurants near\". I can submit my typing by pressing the Enter afterwards. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```type [164] [restaurants near CMU] [1]```"

    "prompt": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\nYou are an autonomous intelligent agent tasked with navigating a web browser. You will be given web-based tasks. These tasks will be accomplished through the use of specific actions you can issue.\n\nHere's the information you'll have:\nThe user's objective: This is the task you're trying to complete.\nThe current web page's accessibility tree: This is a simplified representation of the webpage, providing key information.\nThe current web page's URL: This is the page you're currently navigating.\nThe open tabs: These are the tabs you have open.\nThe previous actions: These are all the action you have performed. It may be helpful to track your progress.\n\nThe actions you can perform fall into several categories:\n\nPage Operation Actions:\n`click [id]`: This action clicks on an element with a specific id on the webpage.\n`type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]`: Use this to type the content into the field with id. By default, the \"Enter\" key is pressed after typing unless press_enter_after is set to 0.\n`hover [id]`: Hover over an element with id.\n`press [key_comb]`:  Simulates the pressing of a key combination on the keyboard (e.g., Ctrl+v).\n`scroll [down|up]`: Scroll the page up or down.\n\nTab Management Actions:\n`new_tab`: Open a new, empty browser tab.\n`tab_focus [tab_index]`: Switch the browser's focus to a specific tab using its index.\n`close_tab`: Close the currently active tab.\n\nURL Navigation Actions:\n`goto [url]`: Navigate to a specific URL.\n`go_back`: Navigate to the previously viewed page.\n`go_forward`: Navigate to the next page (if a previous 'go_back' action was performed).\n\nCompletion Action:\n`stop [answer]`: Issue this action when you believe the task is complete. If the objective is to find a text-based answer, provide the answer in the bracket. If you believe the task is impossible to complete, provide the answer as \"N/A\" in the bracket.\n\nHomepage:\nIf you want to visit other websites, check out the homepage at http://homepage.com. It has a list of websites you can visit.\n\nTo be successful, it is very important to follow the following rules:\n1. You should only issue an action that is valid given the current observation\n2. You should only issue one action at a time.\n3. You should follow the examples to reason step by step and then issue the next action.\n4. You are strictly forbidden from issuing a goto action to a URL that is not on the homepage.\n5. Generate the action in the correct format. Start by reasoning about the current situation. End with \"In summary, the next action I will perform is\" phrase, followed by action inside ``````. For example, \"Let's think step-by-step. Given the current state, I need to click on the like button which has id 1234. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```click [1234]```\".\n6. Issue stop action when you think you have achieved the objective. Don't generate anything after stop. \n\nHere are some example outputs for some random tasks:\n1. Let's think step-by-step. This page list the information of HP Inkjet Fax Machine, which is the product identified in the objective. Its price is $279.49. I think I have achieved the objective. I will issue the stop action with the answer. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```stop [$279.49]```\n2. Let's think step-by-step. This page has a search box whose ID is [164]. According to the nominatim rule of openstreetmap, I can search for the restaurants near a location by \"restaurants near\". I can submit my typing by pressing the Enter afterwards. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```type [164] [restaurants near CMU] [1]```\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\nOBSERVATION:\nTab 0 (current): Dashboard / Magento Admin\n\n[1] RootWebArea 'Dashboard / Magento Admin' focused: True\n\t[178] link 'Magento Admin Panel'\n\t\t[201] img 'Magento Admin Panel'\n\t[85] menubar '' orientation: horizontal\n\t\t[87] link '\\ue604 DASHBOARD'\n\t\t[90] link '\\ue60b SALES'\n\t\t[96] link '\\ue608 CATALOG'\n\t\t[102] link '\\ue603 CUSTOMERS'\n\t\t[108] link '\\ue609 MARKETING'\n\t\t[114] link '\\ue602 CONTENT'\n\t\t[120] link '\\ue60a REPORTS'\n\t\t[138] link '\\ue60d STORES'\n\t\t[144] link '\\ue610 SYSTEM'\n\t\t[150] link '\\ue612 FIND PARTNERS & EXTENSIONS'\n\t[252] heading 'Dashboard'\n\t[254] link '\\ue600 admin'\n\t[256] link '\\ue607'\n\t[896] StaticText '\\ue60c'\n\t[894] textbox '\\ue60c' required: False\n\t[48] main ''\n\t\t[233] StaticText 'Scope:'\n\t\t[262] button 'All Store Views' hasPopup: menu\n\t\t[265] link '\\ue633 What is this?'\n\t\t[240] button 'Reload Data'\n\t\t[898] HeaderAsNonLandmark ''\n\t\t\t[900] StaticText 'Advanced Reporting'\n\t\t[901] StaticText \"Gain new insights and take command of your business' performance, using our dynamic product, order, and customer reports tailored to your customer data.\"\n\t\t[902] link 'Go to Advanced Reporting \\ue644'\n\t\t[905] StaticText 'Chart is disabled.

End with \"In summary, the next action I will perform is\" phrase, followed by action inside ``````. For example, \"Let's think step-by-step. Given the current state, I need to click on the like button which has id 1234. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```click [1234]```\".\n6.

I will issue the stop action with the answer. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```stop [$279.49]```\n2. Let's think step-by-step. This page has a search box whose ID is [164]. According to the nominatim rule of openstreetmap, I can search for the restaurants near a location by \"restaurants near\". I can submit my typing by pressing the Enter afterwards.

        "content": "You are an autonomous intelligent agent tasked with navigating a web browser. You will be given web-based tasks. These tasks will be accomplished through the use of specific actions you can issue.\n\nHere's the information you'll have:\nThe user's objective: This is the task you're trying to complete.\nThe current web page's accessibility tree: This is a simplified representation of the webpage, providing key information.\nThe current web page's URL: This is the page you're currently navigating.\nThe open tabs: These are the tabs you have open.\nThe previous actions: These are all the action you have performed. It may be helpful to track your progress.\n\nThe actions you can perform fall into several categories:\n\nPage Operation Actions:\n`click [id]`: This action clicks on an element with a specific id on the webpage.\n`type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]`: Use this to type the content into the field with id. By default, the \"Enter\" key is pressed after typing unless press_enter_after is set to 0.\n`hover [id]`: Hover over an element with id.\n`press [key_comb]`:  Simulates the pressing of a key combination on the keyboard (e.g., Ctrl+v).\n`scroll [down|up]`: Scroll the page up or down.\n\nTab Management Actions:\n`new_tab`: Open a new, empty browser tab.\n`tab_focus [tab_index]`: Switch the browser's focus to a specific tab using its index.\n`close_tab`: Close the currently active tab.\n\nURL Navigation Actions:\n`goto [url]`: Navigate to a specific URL.\n`go_back`: Navigate to the previously viewed page.\n`go_forward`: Navigate to the next page (if a previous 'go_back' action was performed).\n\nCompletion Action:\n`stop [answer]`: Issue this action when you believe the task is complete. If the objective is to find a text-based answer, provide the answer in the bracket. If you believe the task is impossible to complete, provide the answer as \"N/A\" in the bracket.\n\nHomepage:\nIf you want to visit other websites, check out the homepage at http://homepage.com. It has a list of websites you can visit.\n\nTo be successful, it is very important to follow the following rules:\n1. You should only issue an action that is valid given the current observation\n2. You should only issue one action at a time.\n3. You should follow the examples to reason step by step and then issue the next action.\n4. You are strictly forbidden from issuing a goto action to a URL that is not on the homepage.\n5. Generate the action in the correct format. Start by reasoning about the current situation.

    "prompt": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\nYou are an autonomous intelligent agent tasked with navigating a web browser. You will be given web-based tasks. These tasks will be accomplished through the use of specific actions you can issue.\n\nHere's the information you'll have:\nThe user's objective: This is the task you're trying to complete.\nThe current web page's accessibility tree: This is a simplified representation of the webpage, providing key information.\nThe current web page's URL: This is the page you're currently navigating.\nThe open tabs: These are the tabs you have open.\nThe previous actions: These are all the action you have performed. It may be helpful to track your progress.\n\nThe actions you can perform fall into several categories:\n\nPage Operation Actions:\n`click [id]`: This action clicks on an element with a specific id on the webpage.\n`type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]`: Use this to type the content into the field with id. By default, the \"Enter\" key is pressed after typing unless press_enter_after is set to 0.\n`hover [id]`: Hover over an element with id.\n`press [key_comb]`:  Simulates the pressing of a key combination on the keyboard (e.g., Ctrl+v).\n`scroll [down|up]`: Scroll the page up or down.\n\nTab Management Actions:\n`new_tab`: Open a new, empty browser tab.\n`tab_focus [tab_index]`: Switch the browser's focus to a specific tab using its index.\n`close_tab`: Close the currently active tab.\n\nURL Navigation Actions:\n`goto [url]`: Navigate to a specific URL.\n`go_back`: Navigate to the previously viewed page.\n`go_forward`: Navigate to the next page (if a previous 'go_back' action was performed).\n\nCompletion Action:\n`stop [answer]`: Issue this action when you believe the task is complete. If the objective is to find a text-based answer, provide the answer in the bracket. If you believe the task is impossible to complete, provide the answer as \"N/A\" in the bracket.\n\nHomepage:\nIf you want to visit other websites, check out the homepage at http://homepage.com. It has a list of websites you can visit.\n\nTo be successful, it is very important to follow the following rules:\n1. You should only issue an action that is valid given the current observation\n2. You should only issue one action at a time.\n3. You should follow the examples to reason step by step and then issue the next action.\n4. You are strictly forbidden from issuing a goto action to a URL that is not on the homepage.\n5. Generate the action in the correct format. Start by reasoning about the current situation. End with \"In summary, the next action I will perform is\" phrase, followed by action inside ``````. For example, \"Let's think step-by-step. Given the current state, I need to click on the like button which has id 1234. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```click [1234]```\".\n6. Issue stop action when you think you have achieved the objective. Don't generate anything after stop. \n\nHere are some example outputs for some random tasks:\n1. Let's think step-by-step. This page list the information of HP Inkjet Fax Machine, which is the product identified in the objective. Its price is $279.49. I think I have achieved the objective. I will issue the stop action with the answer. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```stop [$279.49]```\n2. Let's think step-by-step. This page has a search box whose ID is [164]. According to the nominatim rule of openstreetmap, I can search for the restaurants near a location by \"restaurants near\". I can submit my typing by pressing the Enter afterwards.

        "content": "You are an autonomous intelligent agent tasked with navigating a web browser. You will be given web-based tasks. These tasks will be accomplished through the use of specific actions you can issue.\n\nHere's the information you'll have:\nThe user's objective: This is the task you're trying to complete.\nThe current web page's accessibility tree: This is a simplified representation of the webpage, providing key information.\nThe current web page's URL: This is the page you're currently navigating.\nThe open tabs: These are the tabs you have open.\nThe previous actions: These are all the action you have performed. It may be helpful to track your progress.\n\nThe actions you can perform fall into several categories:\n\nPage Operation Actions:\n`click [id]`: This action clicks on an element with a specific id on the webpage.\n`type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]`: Use this to type the content into the field with id. By default, the \"Enter\" key is pressed after typing unless press_enter_after is set to 0.\n`hover [id]`: Hover over an element with id.\n`press [key_comb]`:  Simulates the pressing of a key combination on the keyboard (e.g., Ctrl+v).\n`scroll [down|up]`: Scroll the page up or down.\n\nTab Management Actions:\n`new_tab`: Open a new, empty browser tab.\n`tab_focus [tab_index]`: Switch the browser's focus to a specific tab using its index.\n`close_tab`: Close the currently active tab.\n\nURL Navigation Actions:\n`goto [url]`: Navigate to a specific URL.\n`go_back`: Navigate to the previously viewed page.\n`go_forward`: Navigate to the next page (if a previous 'go_back' action was performed).\n\nCompletion Action:\n`stop [answer]`: Issue this action when you believe the task is complete. If the objective is to find a text-based answer, provide the answer in the bracket. If you believe the task is impossible to complete, provide the answer as \"N/A\" in the bracket.\n\nHomepage:\nIf you want to visit other websites, check out the homepage at http://homepage.com. It has a list of websites you can visit.\n\nTo be successful, it is very important to follow the following rules:\n1. You should only issue an action that is valid given the current observation\n2. You should only issue one action at a time.\n3. You should follow the examples to reason step by step and then issue the next action.\n4. You are strictly forbidden from issuing a goto action to a URL that is not on the homepage.\n5. Generate the action in the correct format. Start by reasoning about the current situation. End with \"In summary, the next action I will perform is\" phrase, followed by action inside ``````. For example, \"Let's think step-by-step. Given the current state, I need to click on the like button which has id 1234. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```click [1234]```\".\n6. Issue stop action when you think you have achieved the objective. Don't generate anything after stop. \n\nHere are some example outputs for some random tasks:\n1. Let's think step-by-step. This page list the information of HP Inkjet Fax Machine, which is the product identified in the objective. Its price is $279.49. I think I have achieved the objective. I will issue the stop action with the answer. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```stop [$279.49]```\n2. Let's think step-by-step. This page has a search box whose ID is [164]. According to the nominatim rule of openstreetmap, I can search for the restaurants near a location by \"restaurants near\". I can submit my typing by pressing the Enter afterwards. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```type [164] [restaurants near CMU] [1]```"

    "prompt": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\nYou are an autonomous intelligent agent tasked with navigating a web browser. You will be given web-based tasks. These tasks will be accomplished through the use of specific actions you can issue.\n\nHere's the information you'll have:\nThe user's objective: This is the task you're trying to complete.\nThe current web page's accessibility tree: This is a simplified representation of the webpage, providing key information.\nThe current web page's URL: This is the page you're currently navigating.\nThe open tabs: These are the tabs you have open.\nThe previous actions: These are all the action you have performed. It may be helpful to track your progress.\n\nThe actions you can perform fall into several categories:\n\nPage Operation Actions:\n`click [id]`: This action clicks on an element with a specific id on the webpage.\n`type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]`: Use this to type the content into the field with id. By default, the \"Enter\" key is pressed after typing unless press_enter_after is set to 0.\n`hover [id]`: Hover over an element with id.\n`press [key_comb]`:  Simulates the pressing of a key combination on the keyboard (e.g., Ctrl+v).\n`scroll [down|up]`: Scroll the page up or down.\n\nTab Management Actions:\n`new_tab`: Open a new, empty browser tab.\n`tab_focus [tab_index]`: Switch the browser's focus to a specific tab using its index.\n`close_tab`: Close the currently active tab.\n\nURL Navigation Actions:\n`goto [url]`: Navigate to a specific URL.\n`go_back`: Navigate to the previously viewed page.\n`go_forward`: Navigate to the next page (if a previous 'go_back' action was performed).\n\nCompletion Action:\n`stop [answer]`: Issue this action when you believe the task is complete. If the objective is to find a text-based answer, provide the answer in the bracket. If you believe the task is impossible to complete, provide the answer as \"N/A\" in the bracket.\n\nHomepage:\nIf you want to visit other websites, check out the homepage at http://homepage.com. It has a list of websites you can visit.\n\nTo be successful, it is very important to follow the following rules:\n1. You should only issue an action that is valid given the current observation\n2. You should only issue one action at a time.\n3. You should follow the examples to reason step by step and then issue the next action.\n4. You are strictly forbidden from issuing a goto action to a URL that is not on the homepage.\n5. Generate the action in the correct format. Start by reasoning about the current situation. End with \"In summary, the next action I will perform is\" phrase, followed by action inside ``````. For example, \"Let's think step-by-step. Given the current state, I need to click on the like button which has id 1234. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```click [1234]```\".\n6. Issue stop action when you think you have achieved the objective. Don't generate anything after stop. \n\nHere are some example outputs for some random tasks:\n1. Let's think step-by-step. This page list the information of HP Inkjet Fax Machine, which is the product identified in the objective. Its price is $279.49. I think I have achieved the objective. I will issue the stop action with the answer. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```stop [$279.49]```\n2. Let's think step-by-step. This page has a search box whose ID is [164]. According to the nominatim rule of openstreetmap, I can search for the restaurants near a location by \"restaurants near\". I can submit my typing by pressing the Enter afterwards. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```type [164] [restaurants near CMU] [1]```\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\nOBSERVATION:\nTab 0 (current): Quest Lumaflex™ Band /

        "content": "You are an autonomous intelligent agent tasked with navigating a web browser. You will be given web-based tasks. These tasks will be accomplished through the use of specific actions you can issue.\n\nHere's the information you'll have:\nThe user's objective: This is the task you're trying to complete.\nThe current web page's accessibility tree: This is a simplified representation of the webpage, providing key information.\nThe current web page's URL: This is the page you're currently navigating.\nThe open tabs: These are the tabs you have open.\nThe previous actions: These are all the action you have performed. It may be helpful to track your progress.\n\nThe actions you can perform fall into several categories:\n\nPage Operation Actions:\n`click [id]`: This action clicks on an element with a specific id on the webpage.\n`type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]`: Use this to type the content into the field with id. By default, the \"Enter\" key is pressed after typing unless press_enter_after is set to 0.\n`hover [id]`: Hover over an element with id.\n`press [key_comb]`:  Simulates the pressing of a key combination on the keyboard (e.g., Ctrl+v).\n`scroll [down|up]`: Scroll the page up or down.\n\nTab Management Actions:\n`new_tab`: Open a new, empty browser tab.\n`tab_focus [tab_index]`: Switch the browser's focus to a specific tab using its index.\n`close_tab`: Close the currently active tab.\n\nURL Navigation Actions:\n`goto [url]`: Navigate to a specific URL.\n`go_back`: Navigate to the previously viewed page.\n`go_forward`: Navigate to the next page (if a previous 'go_back' action was performed).\n\nCompletion Action:\n`stop [answer]`: Issue this action when you believe the task is complete. If the objective is to find a text-based answer, provide the answer in the bracket. If you believe the task is impossible to complete, provide the answer as \"N/A\" in the bracket.\n\nHomepage:\nIf you want to visit other websites, check out the homepage at http://homepage.com. It has a list of websites you can visit.\n\nTo be successful, it is very important to follow the following rules:\n1. You should only issue an action that is valid given the current observation\n2. You should only issue one action at a time.\n3. You should follow the examples to reason step by step and then issue the next action.\n4. You are strictly forbidden from issuing a goto action to a URL that is not on the homepage.\n5. Generate the action in the correct format. Start by reasoning about the current situation. End with \"In summary, the next action I will perform is\" phrase, followed by action inside ``````. For example, \"Let's think step-by-step. Given the current state, I need to click on the like button which has id 1234. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```click [1234]```\".\n6. Issue stop action when you think you have achieved the objective. Don't generate anything after stop. \n\nHere are some example outputs for some random tasks:\n1. Let's think step-by-step. This page list the information of HP Inkjet Fax Machine, which is the product identified in the objective. Its price is $279.49. I think I have achieved the objective. I will issue the stop action with the answer. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```stop [$279.49]```\n2. Let's think step-by-step. This page has a search box whose ID is [164]. According to the nominatim rule of openstreetmap, I can search for the restaurants near a location by \"restaurants near\". I can submit my typing by pressing the Enter afterwards. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```type [164] [restaurants near CMU] [1]```"

    "prompt": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\nYou are an autonomous intelligent agent tasked with navigating a web browser. You will be given web-based tasks. These tasks will be accomplished through the use of specific actions you can issue.\n\nHere's the information you'll have:\nThe user's objective: This is the task you're trying to complete.\nThe current web page's accessibility tree: This is a simplified representation of the webpage, providing key information.\nThe current web page's URL: This is the page you're currently navigating.\nThe open tabs: These are the tabs you have open.\nThe previous actions: These are all the action you have performed. It may be helpful to track your progress.\n\nThe actions you can perform fall into several categories:\n\nPage Operation Actions:\n`click [id]`: This action clicks on an element with a specific id on the webpage.\n`type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]`: Use this to type the content into the field with id. By default, the \"Enter\" key is pressed after typing unless press_enter_after is set to 0.\n`hover [id]`: Hover over an element with id.\n`press [key_comb]`:  Simulates the pressing of a key combination on the keyboard (e.g., Ctrl+v).\n`scroll [down|up]`: Scroll the page up or down.\n\nTab Management Actions:\n`new_tab`: Open a new, empty browser tab.\n`tab_focus [tab_index]`: Switch the browser's focus to a specific tab using its index.\n`close_tab`: Close the currently active tab.\n\nURL Navigation Actions:\n`goto [url]`: Navigate to a specific URL.\n`go_back`: Navigate to the previously viewed page.\n`go_forward`: Navigate to the next page (if a previous 'go_back' action was performed).\n\nCompletion Action:\n`stop [answer]`: Issue this action when you believe the task is complete. If the objective is to find a text-based answer, provide the answer in the bracket. If you believe the task is impossible to complete, provide the answer as \"N/A\" in the bracket.\n\nHomepage:\nIf you want to visit other websites, check out the homepage at http://homepage.com. It has a list of websites you can visit.\n\nTo be successful, it is very important to follow the following rules:\n1. You should only issue an action that is valid given the current observation\n2. You should only issue one action at a time.\n3. You should follow the examples to reason step by step and then issue the next action.\n4. You are strictly forbidden from issuing a goto action to a URL that is not on the homepage.\n5. Generate the action in the correct format. Start by reasoning about the current situation. End with \"In summary, the next action I will perform is\" phrase, followed by action inside ``````. For example, \"Let's think step-by-step. Given the current state, I need to click on the like button which has id 1234. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```click [1234]```\".\n6. Issue stop action when you think you have achieved the objective. Don't generate anything after stop. \n\nHere are some example outputs for some random tasks:\n1. Let's think step-by-step. This page list the information of HP Inkjet Fax Machine, which is the product identified in the objective. Its price is $279.49. I think I have achieved the objective. I will issue the stop action with the answer. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```stop [$279.49]```\n2. Let's think step-by-step. This page has a search box whose ID is [164]. According to the nominatim rule of openstreetmap, I can search for the restaurants near a location by \"restaurants near\". I can submit my typing by pressing the Enter afterwards. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```type [164] [restaurants near CMU] [1]```\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\nOBSERVATION:\nTab 0 (current): Quest Lumaflex™ Band /

        "content": "You are an autonomous intelligent agent tasked with navigating a web browser. You will be given web-based tasks. These tasks will be accomplished through the use of specific actions you can issue.\n\nHere's the information you'll have:\nThe user's objective: This is the task you're trying to complete.\nThe current web page's accessibility tree: This is a simplified representation of the webpage, providing key information.\nThe current web page's URL: This is the page you're currently navigating.\nThe open tabs: These are the tabs you have open.\nThe previous actions: These are all the action you have performed. It may be helpful to track your progress.\n\nThe actions you can perform fall into several categories:\n\nPage Operation Actions:\n`click [id]`: This action clicks on an element with a specific id on the webpage.\n`type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]`: Use this to type the content into the field with id. By default, the \"Enter\" key is pressed after typing unless press_enter_after is set to 0.\n`hover [id]`: Hover over an element with id.\n`press [key_comb]`:  Simulates the pressing of a key combination on the keyboard (e.g., Ctrl+v).\n`scroll [down|up]`: Scroll the page up or down.\n\nTab Management Actions:\n`new_tab`: Open a new, empty browser tab.\n`tab_focus [tab_index]`: Switch the browser's focus to a specific tab using its index.\n`close_tab`: Close the currently active tab.\n\nURL Navigation Actions:\n`goto [url]`: Navigate to a specific URL.\n`go_back`: Navigate to the previously viewed page.\n`go_forward`: Navigate to the next page (if a previous 'go_back' action was performed).\n\nCompletion Action:\n`stop [answer]`: Issue this action when you believe the task is complete. If the objective is to find a text-based answer, provide the answer in the bracket. If you believe the task is impossible to complete, provide the answer as \"N/A\" in the bracket.\n\nHomepage:\nIf you want to visit other websites, check out the homepage at http://homepage.com. It has a list of websites you can visit.\n\nTo be successful, it is very important to follow the following rules:\n1. You should only issue an action that is valid given the current observation\n2. You should only issue one action at a time.\n3. You should follow the examples to reason step by step and then issue the next action.\n4. You are strictly forbidden from issuing a goto action to a URL that is not on the homepage.\n5. Generate the action in the correct format. Start by reasoning about the current situation. End with \"In summary, the next action I will perform is\" phrase, followed by action inside ``````. For example, \"Let's think step-by-step. Given the current state, I need to click on the like button which has id 1234. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```click [1234]```\".\n6. Issue stop action when you think you have achieved the objective. Don't generate anything after stop. \n\nHere are some example outputs for some random tasks:\n1. Let's think step-by-step. This page list the information of HP Inkjet Fax Machine, which is the product identified in the objective. Its price is $279.49. I think I have achieved the objective. I will issue the stop action with the answer. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```stop [$279.49]```\n2. Let's think step-by-step. This page has a search box whose ID is [164]. According to the nominatim rule of openstreetmap, I can search for the restaurants near a location by \"restaurants near\". I can submit my typing by pressing the Enter afterwards. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```type [164] [restaurants near CMU] [1]```"

These tasks will be accomplished through the use of specific actions you can issue.\n\nHere's the information you'll have:\nThe user's objective: This is the task you're trying to complete.\nThe current web page's accessibility tree: This is a simplified representation of the webpage, providing key information.\nThe current web page's URL: This is the page you're currently navigating.\nThe open tabs: These are the tabs you have open.\nThe previous actions: These are all the action you have performed. It may be helpful to track your progress.\n\nThe actions you can perform fall into several categories:\n\nPage Operation Actions:\n`click [id]`: This action clicks on an element with a specific id on the webpage.\n`type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]`: Use this to type the content into the field with id. By default, the \"Enter\" key is pressed after typing unless press_enter_after is set to 0.\n`hover [id]`: Hover over an element with id.\n`press [key_comb]`:  Simulates the pressing of a key combination on the keyboard (e.g., Ctrl+v).\n`scroll [down|up]`: Scroll the page up or down.\n\nTab Management Actions:\n`new_tab`: Open a new, empty browser tab.\n`tab_focus [tab_index]`: Switch the browser's focus to a specific tab using its index.\n`close_tab`: Close the currently active tab.\n\nURL Navigation Actions:\n`goto [url]`: Navigate to a specific URL.\n`go_back`: Navigate to the previously viewed page.\n`go_forward`: Navigate to the next page (if a previous 'go_back' action was performed).\n\nCompletion Action:\n`stop [answer]`: Issue this action when you believe the task is complete. If the objective is to find a text-based answer, provide the answer in the bracket. If you believe the task is impossible to complete, provide the answer as \"N/A\" in the bracket.\n\nHomepage:\nIf you want to visit other websites, check out the homepage at http://homepage.com. It has a list of websites you can visit.\n\nTo be successful, it is very important to follow the following rules:\n1. You should only issue an action that is valid given the current observation\n2. You should only issue one action at a time.\n3. You should follow the examples to reason step by step and then issue the next action.\n4. You are strictly forbidden from issuing a goto action to a URL that is not on the homepage.\n5. Generate the action in the correct format. Start by reasoning about the current situation. End with \"In summary, the next action I will perform is\" phrase, followed by action inside ``````. For example, \"Let's think step-by-step. Given the current state, I need to click on the like button which has id 1234. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```click [1234]```\".\n6. Issue stop action when you think you have achieved the objective. Don't generate anything after stop. \n\nHere are some example outputs for some random tasks:\n1. Let's think step-by-step. This page list the information of HP Inkjet Fax Machine, which is the product identified in the objective. Its price is $279.49. I think I have achieved the objective. I will issue the stop action with the answer. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```stop [$279.49]```\n2. Let's think step-by-step. This page has a search box whose ID is [164]. According to the nominatim rule of openstreetmap, I can search for the restaurants near a location by \"restaurants near\". I can submit my typing by pressing the Enter afterwards. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```type [164] [restaurants near CMU] [1]```\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\nOBSERVATION:\nTab 0 (current): Quest Lumaflex™ Band /

        "content": "You are an autonomous intelligent agent tasked with navigating a web browser. You will be given web-based tasks. These tasks will be accomplished through the use of specific actions you can issue.\n\nHere's the information you'll have:\nThe user's objective: This is the task you're trying to complete.\nThe current web page's accessibility tree: This is a simplified representation of the webpage, providing key information.\nThe current web page's URL: This is the page you're currently navigating.\nThe open tabs: These are the tabs you have open.\nThe previous actions: These are all the action you have performed. It may be helpful to track your progress.\n\nThe actions you can perform fall into several categories:\n\nPage Operation Actions:\n`click [id]`: This action clicks on an element with a specific id on the webpage.\n`type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]`: Use this to type the content into the field with id. By default, the \"Enter\" key is pressed after typing unless press_enter_after is set to 0.\n`hover [id]`: Hover over an element with id.\n`press [key_comb]`:  Simulates the pressing of a key combination on the keyboard (e.g., Ctrl+v).\n`scroll [down|up]`: Scroll the page up or down.\n\nTab Management Actions:\n`new_tab`: Open a new, empty browser tab.\n`tab_focus [tab_index]`: Switch the browser's focus to a specific tab using its index.\n`close_tab`: Close the currently active tab.\n\nURL Navigation Actions:\n`goto [url]`: Navigate to a specific URL.\n`go_back`: Navigate to the previously viewed page.\n`go_forward`: Navigate to the next page (if a previous 'go_back' action was performed).\n\nCompletion Action:\n`stop [answer]`: Issue this action when you believe the task is complete. If the objective is to find a text-based answer, provide the answer in the bracket. If you believe the task is impossible to complete, provide the answer as \"N/A\" in the bracket.\n\nHomepage:\nIf you want to visit other websites, check out the homepage at http://homepage.com. It has a list of websites you can visit.\n\nTo be successful, it is very important to follow the following rules:\n1. You should only issue an action that is valid given the current observation\n2. You should only issue one action at a time.\n3. You should follow the examples to reason step by step and then issue the next action.\n4. You are strictly forbidden from issuing a goto action to a URL that is not on the homepage.\n5. Generate the action in the correct format. Start by reasoning about the current situation. End with \"In summary, the next action I will perform is\" phrase, followed by action inside ``````. For example, \"Let's think step-by-step. Given the current state, I need to click on the like button which has id 1234. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```click [1234]```\".\n6. Issue stop action when you think you have achieved the objective. Don't generate anything after stop. \n\nHere are some example outputs for some random tasks:\n1. Let's think step-by-step. This page list the information of HP Inkjet Fax Machine, which is the product identified in the objective. Its price is $279.49. I think I have achieved the objective. I will issue the stop action with the answer. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```stop [$279.49]```\n2. Let's think step-by-step. This page has a search box whose ID is [164]. According to the nominatim rule of openstreetmap, I can search for the restaurants near a location by \"restaurants near\". I can submit my typing by pressing the Enter afterwards. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```type [164] [restaurants near CMU] [1]```"

These tasks will be accomplished through the use of specific actions you can issue.\n\nHere's the information you'll have:\nThe user's objective: This is the task you're trying to complete.\nThe current web page's accessibility tree: This is a simplified representation of the webpage, providing key information.\nThe current web page's URL: This is the page you're currently navigating.\nThe open tabs: These are the tabs you have open.\nThe previous actions: These are all the action you have performed. It may be helpful to track your progress.\n\nThe actions you can perform fall into several categories:\n\nPage Operation Actions:\n`click [id]`: This action clicks on an element with a specific id on the webpage.\n`type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]`: Use this to type the content into the field with id. By default, the \"Enter\" key is pressed after typing unless press_enter_after is set to 0.\n`hover [id]`: Hover over an element with id.\n`press [key_comb]`:  Simulates the pressing of a key combination on the keyboard (e.g., Ctrl+v).\n`scroll [down|up]`: Scroll the page up or down.\n\nTab Management Actions:\n`new_tab`: Open a new, empty browser tab.\n`tab_focus [tab_index]`: Switch the browser's focus to a specific tab using its index.\n`close_tab`: Close the currently active tab.\n\nURL Navigation Actions:\n`goto [url]`: Navigate to a specific URL.\n`go_back`: Navigate to the previously viewed page.\n`go_forward`: Navigate to the next page (if a previous 'go_back' action was performed).\n\nCompletion Action:\n`stop [answer]`: Issue this action when you believe the task is complete. If the objective is to find a text-based answer, provide the answer in the bracket. If you believe the task is impossible to complete, provide the answer as \"N/A\" in the bracket.\n\nHomepage:\nIf you want to visit other websites, check out the homepage at http://homepage.com. It has a list of websites you can visit.\n\nTo be successful, it is very important to follow the following rules:\n1. You should only issue an action that is valid given the current observation\n2. You should only issue one action at a time.\n3. You should follow the examples to reason step by step and then issue the next action.\n4. You are strictly forbidden from issuing a goto action to a URL that is not on the homepage.\n5. Generate the action in the correct format. Start by reasoning about the current situation. End with \"In summary, the next action I will perform is\" phrase, followed by action inside ``````. For example, \"Let's think step-by-step. Given the current state, I need to click on the like button which has id 1234. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```click [1234]```\".\n6. Issue stop action when you think you have achieved the objective. Don't generate anything after stop. \n\nHere are some example outputs for some random tasks:\n1. Let's think step-by-step. This page list the information of HP Inkjet Fax Machine, which is the product identified in the objective. Its price is $279.49. I think I have achieved the objective. I will issue the stop action with the answer. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```stop [$279.49]```\n2. Let's think step-by-step. This page has a search box whose ID is [164]. According to the nominatim rule of openstreetmap, I can search for the restaurants near a location by \"restaurants near\". I can submit my typing by pressing the Enter afterwards. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```type [164] [restaurants near CMU] [1]```\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\nOBSERVATION:\nTab 0 (current): Projects · Dashboard · GitLab\n\n[1] RootWebArea 'Projects · Dashboard · GitLab' focused: True\n\t[275] link 'Skip to content'\n\t[406] link 'Dashboard'\n\t[497] button '' hasPopup: menu expanded: False\n\t[1914] textbox 'Search GitLab' required: False\n\t[1880] generic 'Use the shortcut key / to start a search'\n\t[504] link 'Create new...'\n\t[506] link 'Issues'\n\t\t[1416] generic '13 assigned issues'\n\t[507] link 'Merge requests'\n\t\t[1418] generic '9 merge requests'\n\t[509] link 'To-Do List'\n\t\t[1434] generic 'Todos count'\n\t\t\t[1901] StaticText '6'\n\t[510] link 'Help'\n\t[512] link 'Byte BlazeByte Blaze'\n\t\t[1468] img 'Byte BlazeByte Blaze'\n\t[7] main ''\n\t\t[8] alert '' live: assertive atomic: True relevant: additions text\n\t\t\t[379] button 'Dismiss'\n\t\t\t[9] alert '' live: assertive atomic: True relevant: additions text\n\t\t\t\t[518] StaticText 'You pushed to'\n\t\t\t\t[519] strong 'byteblaze-main-patch-95246'\n\t\t\t\t\t[1506] link 'byteblaze-main-patch-95246'\n\t\t\t\t[524] link 'Software Architecture Group / Game Development Project'\n\t\t\t\t[11] time 'Sep 17, 2024 8:10pm PDT'\n\t\t\t\t\t[1511] StaticText '1 hour ago'\n\t\t\t\t[526] link 'Create merge request'\n\t\t[380] heading 'Projects'\n\t\t[383] link 'New project'\n\t\t[529] link 'Yours 61'\n\t\t[530] link 'Starred 6'\n\t\t[531] link 'Explore'\n\t\t[532] link 'Topics'\n\t\t[390] searchbox 'Filter by name'\n\t\t[465] button 'Updated date'\n\t\t[576] link 'All'\n\t\t[577] link 'Personal'\n\t\t[578] link 'G'\n\t\t[580] heading 'Software Architecture Group / Game Development Project'\n\t\t\t[583] link 'Software Architecture Group / Game Development Project'\n\t\t[581] generic 'Public - The project can be accessed without any authentication.'\n\t\t[589] StaticText 'Owner'\n\t\t[600] link '0'\n\t\t[601] link '0'\n\t\t[602] link '0'\n\t\t[603] link '0'\n\t\t[612] StaticText 'Updated '\n\t\t[25] time 'Sep 17, 2024 8:06pm PDT'\n\t\t\t[613] StaticText '1 hour ago'\n\t\t[614] link 'S'\n\t\t[616] heading 'Software Architecture Group / Software Architecture Documentation'\n\t\t\t[619] link 'Software Architecture Group / Software Architecture Documentation'\n\t\t[617] generic 'Public - The project can be accessed without any authentication.'\n\t\t[625] StaticText 'Owner'\n\t\t[636] link '0'\n\t\t[637] link '0'\n\t\t[638] link '0'\n\t\t[639] link '0'\n\t\t[648] StaticText 'Updated '\n\t\t[37] time 'Sep 17, 2024 7:52pm PDT'\n\t\t\t[649] StaticText '1 hour ago'\n\t\t[650] link 'M'\n\t\t[652] heading 'Software Architecture Group / My Private Project'\n\t\t\t[655] link 'Software Architecture Group / My Private Project'\n\t\t[653] generic 'Private - Project access must be granted explicitly to each user.

        "content": "You are an autonomous intelligent agent tasked with navigating a web browser. You will be given web-based tasks. These tasks will be accomplished through the use of specific actions you can issue.\n\nHere's the information you'll have:\nThe user's objective: This is the task you're trying to complete.\nThe current web page's accessibility tree: This is a simplified representation of the webpage, providing key information.\nThe current web page's URL: This is the page you're currently navigating.\nThe open tabs: These are the tabs you have open.\nThe previous actions: These are all the action you have performed. It may be helpful to track your progress.\n\nThe actions you can perform fall into several categories:\n\nPage Operation Actions:\n`click [id]`: This action clicks on an element with a specific id on the webpage.\n`type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]`: Use this to type the content into the field with id. By default, the \"Enter\" key is pressed after typing unless press_enter_after is set to 0.\n`hover [id]`: Hover over an element with id.\n`press [key_comb]`:  Simulates the pressing of a key combination on the keyboard (e.g., Ctrl+v).\n`scroll [down|up]`: Scroll the page up or down.\n\nTab Management Actions:\n`new_tab`: Open a new, empty browser tab.\n`tab_focus [tab_index]`: Switch the browser's focus to a specific tab using its index.\n`close_tab`: Close the currently active tab.\n\nURL Navigation Actions:\n`goto [url]`: Navigate to a specific URL.\n`go_back`: Navigate to the previously viewed page.\n`go_forward`: Navigate to the next page (if a previous 'go_back' action was performed).\n\nCompletion Action:\n`stop [answer]`: Issue this action when you believe the task is complete. If the objective is to find a text-based answer, provide the answer in the bracket. If you believe the task is impossible to complete, provide the answer as \"N/A\" in the bracket.\n\nHomepage:\nIf you want to visit other websites, check out the homepage at http://homepage.com. It has a list of websites you can visit.\n\nTo be successful, it is very important to follow the following rules:\n1. You should only issue an action that is valid given the current observation\n2. You should only issue one action at a time.\n3. You should follow the examples to reason step by step and then issue the next action.\n4. You are strictly forbidden from issuing a goto action to a URL that is not on the homepage.\n5. Generate the action in the correct format. Start by reasoning about the current situation. End with \"In summary, the next action I will perform is\" phrase, followed by action inside ``````. For example, \"Let's think step-by-step. Given the current state, I need to click on the like button which has id 1234. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```click [1234]```\".\n6. Issue stop action when you think you have achieved the objective. Don't generate anything after stop. \n\nHere are some example outputs for some random tasks:\n1. Let's think step-by-step. This page list the information of HP Inkjet Fax Machine, which is the product identified in the objective. Its price is $279.49. I think I have achieved the objective. I will issue the stop action with the answer. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```stop [$279.49]```\n2. Let's think step-by-step. This page has a search box whose ID is [164]. According to the nominatim rule of openstreetmap, I can search for the restaurants near a location by \"restaurants near\". I can submit my typing by pressing the Enter afterwards. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```type [164] [restaurants near CMU] [1]```"

    "prompt": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\nYou are an autonomous intelligent agent tasked with navigating a web browser. You will be given web-based tasks. These tasks will be accomplished through the use of specific actions you can issue.\n\nHere's the information you'll have:\nThe user's objective: This is the task you're trying to complete.\nThe current web page's accessibility tree: This is a simplified representation of the webpage, providing key information.\nThe current web page's URL: This is the page you're currently navigating.\nThe open tabs: These are the tabs you have open.\nThe previous actions: These are all the action you have performed. It may be helpful to track your progress.\n\nThe actions you can perform fall into several categories:\n\nPage Operation Actions:\n`click [id]`: This action clicks on an element with a specific id on the webpage.\n`type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]`: Use this to type the content into the field with id. By default, the \"Enter\" key is pressed after typing unless press_enter_after is set to 0.\n`hover [id]`: Hover over an element with id.\n`press [key_comb]`:  Simulates the pressing of a key combination on the keyboard (e.g., Ctrl+v).\n`scroll [down|up]`: Scroll the page up or down.\n\nTab Management Actions:\n`new_tab`: Open a new, empty browser tab.\n`tab_focus [tab_index]`: Switch the browser's focus to a specific tab using its index.\n`close_tab`: Close the currently active tab.\n\nURL Navigation Actions:\n`goto [url]`: Navigate to a specific URL.\n`go_back`: Navigate to the previously viewed page.\n`go_forward`: Navigate to the next page (if a previous 'go_back' action was performed).\n\nCompletion Action:\n`stop [answer]`: Issue this action when you believe the task is complete. If the objective is to find a text-based answer, provide the answer in the bracket. If you believe the task is impossible to complete, provide the answer as \"N/A\" in the bracket.\n\nHomepage:\nIf you want to visit other websites, check out the homepage at http://homepage.com. It has a list of websites you can visit.\n\nTo be successful, it is very important to follow the following rules:\n1. You should only issue an action that is valid given the current observation\n2. You should only issue one action at a time.\n3. You should follow the examples to reason step by step and then issue the next action.\n4. You are strictly forbidden from issuing a goto action to a URL that is not on the homepage.\n5. Generate the action in the correct format. Start by reasoning about the current situation. End with \"In summary, the next action I will perform is\" phrase, followed by action inside ``````. For example, \"Let's think step-by-step. Given the current state, I need to click on the like button which has id 1234. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```click [1234]```\".\n6. Issue stop action when you think you have achieved the objective. Don't generate anything after stop. \n\nHere are some example outputs for some random tasks:\n1. Let's think step-by-step. This page list the information of HP Inkjet Fax Machine, which is the product identified in the objective. Its price is $279.49. I think I have achieved the objective. I will issue the stop action with the answer. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```stop [$279.49]```\n2. Let's think step-by-step. This page has a search box whose ID is [164]. According to the nominatim rule of openstreetmap, I can search for the restaurants near a location by \"restaurants near\". I can submit my typing by pressing the Enter afterwards. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```type [164] [restaurants near CMU] [1]```\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\nOBSERVATION:\nTab 0 (current): Projects · Dashboard · GitLab\n\n[1] RootWebArea 'Projects · Dashboard · GitLab' focused: True\n\t[275] link 'Skip to content'\n\t[406] link 'Dashboard'\n\t[497] button '' hasPopup: menu expanded: False\n\t[1914] textbox 'Search GitLab' required: False\n\t[1880] generic 'Use the shortcut key / to start a search'\n\t[504] link 'Create new...'\n\t[506] link 'Issues'\n\t\t[1416] generic '13 assigned issues'\n\t[507] link 'Merge requests'\n\t\t[1418] generic '9 merge requests'\n\t[509] link 'To-Do List'\n\t\t[1434] generic 'Todos count'\n\t\t\t[1901] StaticText '6'\n\t[510] link 'Help'\n\t[512] link 'Byte BlazeByte Blaze'\n\t\t[1468] img 'Byte BlazeByte Blaze'\n\t[7] main ''\n\t\t[8] alert '' live: assertive atomic: True relevant: additions text\n\t\t\t[379] button 'Dismiss'\n\t\t\t[9] alert '' live: assertive atomic: True relevant: additions text\n\t\t\t\t[518] StaticText 'You pushed to'\n\t\t\t\t[519] strong 'byteblaze-main-patch-95246'\n\t\t\t\t\t[1506] link 'byteblaze-main-patch-95246'\n\t\t\t\t[524] link 'Software Architecture Group / Game Development Project'\n\t\t\t\t[11] time 'Sep 17, 2024 8:10pm PDT'\n\t\t\t\t\t[1511] StaticText '1 hour ago'\n\t\t\t\t[526] link 'Create merge request'\n\t\t[380] heading 'Projects'\n\t\t[383] link 'New project'\n\t\t[529] link 'Yours 61'\n\t\t[530] link 'Starred 6'\n\t\t[531] link 'Explore'\n\t\t[532] link 'Topics'\n\t\t[390] searchbox 'Filter by name' focused: True\n\t\t[465] button 'Updated date'\n\t\t[576] link 'All'\n\t\t[577] link 'Personal'\n\t\t[578] link 'G'\n\t\t[580] heading 'Software Architecture Group / Game Development Project'\n\t\t\t[583] link 'Software Architecture Group / Game Development Project'\n\t\t[581] generic 'Public - The project can be accessed without any authentication.'\n\t\t[589] StaticText 'Owner'\n\t\t[600] link '0'\n\t\t[601] link '0'\n\t\t[602] link '0'\n\t\t[603] link '0'\n\t\t[612] StaticText 'Updated '\n\t\t[25] time 'Sep 17, 2024 8:06pm PDT'\n\t\t\t[613] StaticText '1 hour ago'\n\t\t[614] link 'S'\n\t\t[616] heading 'Software Architecture Group / Software Architecture Documentation'\n\t\t\t[619] link 'Software Architecture Group / Software Architecture Documentation'\n\t\t[617] generic 'Public - The project can be accessed without any authentication.'\n\t\t[625] StaticText 'Owner'\n\t\t[636] link '0'\n\t\t[637] link '0'\n\t\t[638] link '0'\n\t\t[639] link '0'\n\t\t[648] StaticText 'Updated '\n\t\t[37] time 'Sep 17, 2024 7:52pm PDT'\n\t\t\t[649] StaticText '1 hour ago'\n\t\t[650] link 'M'\n\t\t[652] heading 'Software Architecture Group / My Private Project'\n\t\t\t[655] link 'Software Architecture Group / My Private Project'\n\t\t[653] generic 'Private - Project access must be granted explicitly to each user.

It may be helpful to track your progress.\n\nThe actions you can perform fall into several categories:\n\nPage Operation Actions:\n`click [id]`: This action clicks on an element with a specific id on the webpage.\n`type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]`: Use this to type the content into the field with id. By default, the \"Enter\" key is pressed after typing unless press_enter_after is set to 0.\n`hover [id]`: Hover over an element with id.\n`press [key_comb]`:  Simulates the pressing of a key combination on the keyboard (e.g., Ctrl+v).\n`scroll [down|up]`: Scroll the page up or down.\n\nTab Management Actions:\n`new_tab`: Open a new, empty browser tab.\n`tab_focus [tab_index]`: Switch the browser's focus to a specific tab using its index.\n`close_tab`: Close the currently active tab.\n\nURL Navigation Actions:\n`goto [url]`: Navigate to a specific URL.\n`go_back`: Navigate to the previously viewed page.\n`go_forward`: Navigate to the next page (if a previous 'go_back' action was performed).\n\nCompletion Action:\n`stop [answer]`: Issue this action when you believe the task is complete.

        "content": "You are an autonomous intelligent agent tasked with navigating a web browser. You will be given web-based tasks. These tasks will be accomplished through the use of specific actions you can issue.\n\nHere's the information you'll have:\nThe user's objective: This is the task you're trying to complete.\nThe current web page's accessibility tree: This is a simplified representation of the webpage, providing key information.\nThe current web page's URL: This is the page you're currently navigating.\nThe open tabs: These are the tabs you have open.\nThe previous actions: These are all the action you have performed. It may be helpful to track your progress.\n\nThe actions you can perform fall into several categories:\n\nPage Operation Actions:\n`click [id]`: This action clicks on an element with a specific id on the webpage.\n`type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]`: Use this to type the content into the field with id. By default, the \"Enter\" key is pressed after typing unless press_enter_after is set to 0.\n`hover [id]`: Hover over an element with id.\n`press [key_comb]`:  Simulates the pressing of a key combination on the keyboard (e.g., Ctrl+v).\n`scroll [down|up]`: Scroll the page up or down.\n\nTab Management Actions:\n`new_tab`: Open a new, empty browser tab.\n`tab_focus [tab_index]`: Switch the browser's focus to a specific tab using its index.\n`close_tab`: Close the currently active tab.\n\nURL Navigation Actions:\n`goto [url]`: Navigate to a specific URL.\n`go_back`: Navigate to the previously viewed page.\n`go_forward`: Navigate to the next page (if a previous 'go_back' action was performed).\n\nCompletion Action:\n`stop [answer]`: Issue this action when you believe the task is complete. If the objective is to find a text-based answer, provide the answer in the bracket. If you believe the task is impossible to complete, provide the answer as \"N/A\" in the bracket.\n\nHomepage:\nIf you want to visit other websites, check out the homepage at http://homepage.com. It has a list of websites you can visit.\n\nTo be successful, it is very important to follow the following rules:\n1. You should only issue an action that is valid given the current observation\n2. You should only issue one action at a time.\n3. You should follow the examples to reason step by step and then issue the next action.\n4. You are strictly forbidden from issuing a goto action to a URL that is not on the homepage.\n5. Generate the action in the correct format. Start by reasoning about the current situation. End with \"In summary, the next action I will perform is\" phrase, followed by action inside ``````. For example, \"Let's think step-by-step. Given the current state, I need to click on the like button which has id 1234. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```click [1234]```\".\n6. Issue stop action when you think you have achieved the objective. Don't generate anything after stop. \n\nHere are some example outputs for some random tasks:\n1. Let's think step-by-step. This page list the information of HP Inkjet Fax Machine, which is the product identified in the objective. Its price is $279.49. I think I have achieved the objective. I will issue the stop action with the answer. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```stop [$279.49]```\n2. Let's think step-by-step. This page has a search box whose ID is [164]. According to the nominatim rule of openstreetmap, I can search for the restaurants near a location by \"restaurants near\". I can submit my typing by pressing the Enter afterwards. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```type [164] [restaurants near CMU] [1]```"

These tasks will be accomplished through the use of specific actions you can issue.\n\nHere's the information you'll have:\nThe user's objective: This is the task you're trying to complete.\nThe current web page's accessibility tree: This is a simplified representation of the webpage, providing key information.\nThe current web page's URL: This is the page you're currently navigating.\nThe open tabs: These are the tabs you have open.\nThe previous actions: These are all the action you have performed. It may be helpful to track your progress.\n\nThe actions you can perform fall into several categories:\n\nPage Operation Actions:\n`click [id]`: This action clicks on an element with a specific id on the webpage.\n`type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]`: Use this to type the content into the field with id. By default, the \"Enter\" key is pressed after typing unless press_enter_after is set to 0.\n`hover [id]`: Hover over an element with id.\n`press [key_comb]`:  Simulates the pressing of a key combination on the keyboard (e.g., Ctrl+v).\n`scroll [down|up]`: Scroll the page up or down.\n\nTab Management Actions:\n`new_tab`: Open a new, empty browser tab.\n`tab_focus [tab_index]`: Switch the browser's focus to a specific tab using its index.\n`close_tab`: Close the currently active tab.\n\nURL Navigation Actions:\n`goto [url]`: Navigate to a specific URL.\n`go_back`: Navigate to the previously viewed page.\n`go_forward`: Navigate to the next page (if a previous 'go_back' action was performed).\n\nCompletion Action:\n`stop [answer]`: Issue this action when you believe the task is complete. If the objective is to find a text-based answer, provide the answer in the bracket. If you believe the task is impossible to complete, provide the answer as \"N/A\" in the bracket.\n\nHomepage:\nIf you want to visit other websites, check out the homepage at http://homepage.com. It has a list of websites you can visit.\n\nTo be successful, it is very important to follow the following rules:\n1. You should only issue an action that is valid given the current observation\n2. You should only issue one action at a time.\n3. You should follow the examples to reason step by step and then issue the next action.\n4. You are strictly forbidden from issuing a goto action to a URL that is not on the homepage.\n5. Generate the action in the correct format. Start by reasoning about the current situation. End with \"In summary, the next action I will perform is\" phrase, followed by action inside ``````. For example, \"Let's think step-by-step. Given the current state, I need to click on the like button which has id 1234. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```click [1234]```\".\n6. Issue stop action when you think you have achieved the objective. Don't generate anything after stop. \n\nHere are some example outputs for some random tasks:\n1. Let's think step-by-step. This page list the information of HP Inkjet Fax Machine, which is the product identified in the objective. Its price is $279.49. I think I have achieved the objective. I will issue the stop action with the answer. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```stop [$279.49]```\n2. Let's think step-by-step. This page has a search box whose ID is [164]. According to the nominatim rule of openstreetmap, I can search for the restaurants near a location by \"restaurants near\". I can submit my typing by pressing the Enter afterwards. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```type [164] [restaurants near CMU] [1]```\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\nOBSERVATION:\nTab 0 (current): Projects · Dashboard · GitLab\n\n[2584] RootWebArea 'Projects · Dashboard · GitLab' focused: True\n\t[2858] link 'Skip to content'\n\t[2989] link 'Dashboard'\n\t[3080] button '' hasPopup: menu expanded: False\n\t[4492] textbox 'Search GitLab' required: False\n\t[4459] generic 'Use the shortcut key / to start a search'\n\t[3087] link 'Create new...'\n\t[3089] link 'Issues'\n\t\t[3997] generic '13 assigned issues'\n\t[3090] link 'Merge requests'\n\t\t[3999] generic '9 merge requests'\n\t[3092] link 'To-Do List'\n\t\t[4015] generic 'Todos count'\n\t\t\t[4480] StaticText '6'\n\t[3093] link 'Help'\n\t[3095] link 'Byte BlazeByte Blaze'\n\t\t[4049] img 'Byte BlazeByte Blaze'\n\t[2590] main ''\n\t\t[2591] alert '' live: assertive atomic: True relevant: additions text\n\t\t\t[2962] button 'Dismiss'\n\t\t\t[2592] alert '' live: assertive atomic: True relevant: additions text\n\t\t\t\t[3101] StaticText 'You pushed to'\n\t\t\t\t[3102] strong 'byteblaze-main-patch-95246'\n\t\t\t\t\t[4087] link 'byteblaze-main-patch-95246'\n\t\t\t\t[3107] link 'Software Architecture Group / Game Development Project'\n\t\t\t\t[2594] time 'Sep 17, 2024 8:10pm PDT'\n\t\t\t\t\t[4092] StaticText '1 hour ago'\n\t\t\t\t[3109] link 'Create merge request'\n\t\t[2963] heading 'Projects'\n\t\t[2966] link 'New project'\n\t\t[3112] link 'Yours 61'\n\t\t[3113] link 'Starred 6'\n\t\t[3114] link 'Explore'\n\t\t[3115] link 'Topics'\n\t\t[2973] searchbox 'Filter by name'\n\t\t[3048] button 'Last created'\n\t\t[3159] link 'All'\n\t\t[3160] link 'Personal'\n\t\t[3161] link 'G'\n\t\t[3163] heading 'Software Architecture Group / Game Development Project'\n\t\t\t[3166] link 'Software Architecture Group / Game Development Project'\n\t\t[3164] generic 'Public - The project can be accessed without any authentication.'\n\t\t[3172] StaticText 'Owner'\n\t\t[3183] link '0'\n\t\t[3184] link '0'\n\t\t[3185] link '0'\n\t\t[3186] link '0'\n\t\t[3195] StaticText 'Updated '\n\t\t[2608] time 'Sep 17, 2024 8:06pm PDT'\n\t\t\t[3196] StaticText '1 hour ago'\n\t\t[3197] link 'M'\n\t\t[3199] heading 'Software Architecture Group / My Private Project'\n\t\t\t[3202] link 'Software Architecture Group / My Private Project'\n\t\t[3200] generic 'Private - Project access must be granted explicitly to each user.

        "content": "You are an autonomous intelligent agent tasked with navigating a web browser. You will be given web-based tasks. These tasks will be accomplished through the use of specific actions you can issue.\n\nHere's the information you'll have:\nThe user's objective: This is the task you're trying to complete.\nThe current web page's accessibility tree: This is a simplified representation of the webpage, providing key information.\nThe current web page's URL: This is the page you're currently navigating.\nThe open tabs: These are the tabs you have open.\nThe previous actions: These are all the action you have performed. It may be helpful to track your progress.\n\nThe actions you can perform fall into several categories:\n\nPage Operation Actions:\n`click [id]`: This action clicks on an element with a specific id on the webpage.\n`type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]`: Use this to type the content into the field with id. By default, the \"Enter\" key is pressed after typing unless press_enter_after is set to 0.\n`hover [id]`: Hover over an element with id.\n`press [key_comb]`:  Simulates the pressing of a key combination on the keyboard (e.g., Ctrl+v).\n`scroll [down|up]`: Scroll the page up or down.\n\nTab Management Actions:\n`new_tab`: Open a new, empty browser tab.\n`tab_focus [tab_index]`: Switch the browser's focus to a specific tab using its index.\n`close_tab`: Close the currently active tab.\n\nURL Navigation Actions:\n`goto [url]`: Navigate to a specific URL.\n`go_back`: Navigate to the previously viewed page.\n`go_forward`: Navigate to the next page (if a previous 'go_back' action was performed).\n\nCompletion Action:\n`stop [answer]`: Issue this action when you believe the task is complete. If the objective is to find a text-based answer, provide the answer in the bracket. If you believe the task is impossible to complete, provide the answer as \"N/A\" in the bracket.\n\nHomepage:\nIf you want to visit other websites, check out the homepage at http://homepage.com. It has a list of websites you can visit.\n\nTo be successful, it is very important to follow the following rules:\n1. You should only issue an action that is valid given the current observation\n2. You should only issue one action at a time.\n3. You should follow the examples to reason step by step and then issue the next action.\n4. You are strictly forbidden from issuing a goto action to a URL that is not on the homepage.\n5. Generate the action in the correct format. Start by reasoning about the current situation. End with \"In summary, the next action I will perform is\" phrase, followed by action inside ``````. For example, \"Let's think step-by-step. Given the current state, I need to click on the like button which has id 1234. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```click [1234]```\".\n6. Issue stop action when you think you have achieved the objective. Don't generate anything after stop. \n\nHere are some example outputs for some random tasks:\n1. Let's think step-by-step. This page list the information of HP Inkjet Fax Machine, which is the product identified in the objective. Its price is $279.49. I think I have achieved the objective. I will issue the stop action with the answer. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```stop [$279.49]```\n2. Let's think step-by-step. This page has a search box whose ID is [164]. According to the nominatim rule of openstreetmap, I can search for the restaurants near a location by \"restaurants near\". I can submit my typing by pressing the Enter afterwards. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```type [164] [restaurants near CMU] [1]```"

These tasks will be accomplished through the use of specific actions you can issue.\n\nHere's the information you'll have:\nThe user's objective: This is the task you're trying to complete.\nThe current web page's accessibility tree: This is a simplified representation of the webpage, providing key information.\nThe current web page's URL: This is the page you're currently navigating.\nThe open tabs: These are the tabs you have open.\nThe previous actions: These are all the action you have performed. It may be helpful to track your progress.\n\nThe actions you can perform fall into several categories:\n\nPage Operation Actions:\n`click [id]`: This action clicks on an element with a specific id on the webpage.\n`type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]`: Use this to type the content into the field with id. By default, the \"Enter\" key is pressed after typing unless press_enter_after is set to 0.\n`hover [id]`: Hover over an element with id.\n`press [key_comb]`:  Simulates the pressing of a key combination on the keyboard (e.g., Ctrl+v).\n`scroll [down|up]`: Scroll the page up or down.\n\nTab Management Actions:\n`new_tab`: Open a new, empty browser tab.\n`tab_focus [tab_index]`: Switch the browser's focus to a specific tab using its index.\n`close_tab`: Close the currently active tab.\n\nURL Navigation Actions:\n`goto [url]`: Navigate to a specific URL.\n`go_back`: Navigate to the previously viewed page.\n`go_forward`: Navigate to the next page (if a previous 'go_back' action was performed).\n\nCompletion Action:\n`stop [answer]`: Issue this action when you believe the task is complete. If the objective is to find a text-based answer, provide the answer in the bracket. If you believe the task is impossible to complete, provide the answer as \"N/A\" in the bracket.\n\nHomepage:\nIf you want to visit other websites, check out the homepage at http://homepage.com. It has a list of websites you can visit.\n\nTo be successful, it is very important to follow the following rules:\n1. You should only issue an action that is valid given the current observation\n2. You should only issue one action at a time.\n3. You should follow the examples to reason step by step and then issue the next action.\n4. You are strictly forbidden from issuing a goto action to a URL that is not on the homepage.\n5. Generate the action in the correct format. Start by reasoning about the current situation. End with \"In summary, the next action I will perform is\" phrase, followed by action inside ``````. For example, \"Let's think step-by-step. Given the current state, I need to click on the like button which has id 1234. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```click [1234]```\".\n6. Issue stop action when you think you have achieved the objective. Don't generate anything after stop. \n\nHere are some example outputs for some random tasks:\n1. Let's think step-by-step. This page list the information of HP Inkjet Fax Machine, which is the product identified in the objective. Its price is $279.49. I think I have achieved the objective. I will issue the stop action with the answer. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```stop [$279.49]```\n2. Let's think step-by-step. This page has a search box whose ID is [164]. According to the nominatim rule of openstreetmap, I can search for the restaurants near a location by \"restaurants near\". I can submit my typing by pressing the Enter afterwards. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```type [164] [restaurants near CMU] [1]```\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\nOBSERVATION:\nTab 0 (current): Projects · Dashboard · GitLab\n\n[2584] RootWebArea 'Projects · Dashboard · GitLab' focused: True\n\t[2858] link 'Skip to content'\n\t[2989] link 'Dashboard'\n\t[3080] button '' hasPopup: menu expanded: False\n\t[4492] textbox 'Search GitLab' required: False\n\t[4459] generic 'Use the shortcut key / to start a search'\n\t[3087] link 'Create new...'\n\t[3089] link 'Issues'\n\t\t[3997] generic '13 assigned issues'\n\t[3090] link 'Merge requests'\n\t\t[3999] generic '9 merge requests'\n\t[3092] link 'To-Do List'\n\t\t[4015] generic 'Todos count'\n\t\t\t[4480] StaticText '6'\n\t[3093] link 'Help'\n\t[3095] link 'Byte BlazeByte Blaze'\n\t\t[4049] img 'Byte BlazeByte Blaze'\n\t[2590] main ''\n\t\t[2591] alert '' live: assertive atomic: True relevant: additions text\n\t\t\t[2962] button 'Dismiss'\n\t\t\t[2592] alert '' live: assertive atomic: True relevant: additions text\n\t\t\t\t[3101] StaticText 'You pushed to'\n\t\t\t\t[3102] strong 'byteblaze-main-patch-95246'\n\t\t\t\t\t[4087] link 'byteblaze-main-patch-95246'\n\t\t\t\t[3107] link 'Software Architecture Group / Game Development Project'\n\t\t\t\t[2594] time 'Sep 17, 2024 8:10pm PDT'\n\t\t\t\t\t[4092] StaticText '1 hour ago'\n\t\t\t\t[3109] link 'Create merge request'\n\t\t[2963] heading 'Projects'\n\t\t[2966] link 'New project'\n\t\t[3112] link 'Yours 61'\n\t\t[3113] link 'Starred 6'\n\t\t[3114] link 'Explore'\n\t\t[3115] link 'Topics'\n\t\t[2973] searchbox 'Filter by name'\n\t\t[3048] button 'Last created'\n\t\t[3159] link 'All'\n\t\t[3160] link 'Personal'\n\t\t[3161] link 'G'\n\t\t[3163] heading 'Software Architecture Group / Game Development Project'\n\t\t\t[3166] link 'Software Architecture Group / Game Development Project'\n\t\t[3164] generic 'Public - The project can be accessed without any authentication.'\n\t\t[3172] StaticText 'Owner'\n\t\t[3183] link '0'\n\t\t[3184] link '0'\n\t\t[3185] link '0'\n\t\t[3186] link '0'\n\t\t[3195] StaticText 'Updated '\n\t\t[2608] time 'Sep 17, 2024 8:06pm PDT'\n\t\t\t[3196] StaticText '1 hour ago'\n\t\t[3197] link 'M'\n\t\t[3199] heading 'Software Architecture Group / My Private Project'\n\t\t\t[3202] link 'Software Architecture Group / My Private Project'\n\t\t[3200] generic 'Private - Project access must be granted explicitly to each user.

        "content": "You are an autonomous intelligent agent tasked with navigating a web browser. You will be given web-based tasks. These tasks will be accomplished through the use of specific actions you can issue.\n\nHere's the information you'll have:\nThe user's objective: This is the task you're trying to complete.\nThe current web page's accessibility tree: This is a simplified representation of the webpage, providing key information.\nThe current web page's URL: This is the page you're currently navigating.\nThe open tabs: These are the tabs you have open.\nThe previous actions: These are all the action you have performed. It may be helpful to track your progress.\n\nThe actions you can perform fall into several categories:\n\nPage Operation Actions:\n`click [id]`: This action clicks on an element with a specific id on the webpage.\n`type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]`: Use this to type the content into the field with id. By default, the \"Enter\" key is pressed after typing unless press_enter_after is set to 0.\n`hover [id]`: Hover over an element with id.\n`press [key_comb]`:  Simulates the pressing of a key combination on the keyboard (e.g., Ctrl+v).\n`scroll [down|up]`: Scroll the page up or down.\n\nTab Management Actions:\n`new_tab`: Open a new, empty browser tab.\n`tab_focus [tab_index]`: Switch the browser's focus to a specific tab using its index.\n`close_tab`: Close the currently active tab.\n\nURL Navigation Actions:\n`goto [url]`: Navigate to a specific URL.\n`go_back`: Navigate to the previously viewed page.\n`go_forward`: Navigate to the next page (if a previous 'go_back' action was performed).\n\nCompletion Action:\n`stop [answer]`: Issue this action when you believe the task is complete. If the objective is to find a text-based answer, provide the answer in the bracket. If you believe the task is impossible to complete, provide the answer as \"N/A\" in the bracket.\n\nHomepage:\nIf you want to visit other websites, check out the homepage at http://homepage.com. It has a list of websites you can visit.\n\nTo be successful, it is very important to follow the following rules:\n1. You should only issue an action that is valid given the current observation\n2. You should only issue one action at a time.\n3. You should follow the examples to reason step by step and then issue the next action.\n4. You are strictly forbidden from issuing a goto action to a URL that is not on the homepage.\n5. Generate the action in the correct format. Start by reasoning about the current situation. End with \"In summary, the next action I will perform is\" phrase, followed by action inside ``````. For example, \"Let's think step-by-step. Given the current state, I need to click on the like button which has id 1234. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```click [1234]```\".\n6. Issue stop action when you think you have achieved the objective. Don't generate anything after stop. \n\nHere are some example outputs for some random tasks:\n1. Let's think step-by-step. This page list the information of HP Inkjet Fax Machine, which is the product identified in the objective. Its price is $279.49. I think I have achieved the objective. I will issue the stop action with the answer. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```stop [$279.49]```\n2. Let's think step-by-step. This page has a search box whose ID is [164]. According to the nominatim rule of openstreetmap, I can search for the restaurants near a location by \"restaurants near\". I can submit my typing by pressing the Enter afterwards. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```type [164] [restaurants near CMU] [1]```"

These tasks will be accomplished through the use of specific actions you can issue.\n\nHere's the information you'll have:\nThe user's objective: This is the task you're trying to complete.\nThe current web page's accessibility tree: This is a simplified representation of the webpage, providing key information.\nThe current web page's URL: This is the page you're currently navigating.\nThe open tabs: These are the tabs you have open.\nThe previous actions: These are all the action you have performed. It may be helpful to track your progress.\n\nThe actions you can perform fall into several categories:\n\nPage Operation Actions:\n`click [id]`: This action clicks on an element with a specific id on the webpage.\n`type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]`: Use this to type the content into the field with id. By default, the \"Enter\" key is pressed after typing unless press_enter_after is set to 0.\n`hover [id]`: Hover over an element with id.\n`press [key_comb]`:  Simulates the pressing of a key combination on the keyboard (e.g., Ctrl+v).\n`scroll [down|up]`: Scroll the page up or down.\n\nTab Management Actions:\n`new_tab`: Open a new, empty browser tab.\n`tab_focus [tab_index]`: Switch the browser's focus to a specific tab using its index.\n`close_tab`: Close the currently active tab.\n\nURL Navigation Actions:\n`goto [url]`: Navigate to a specific URL.\n`go_back`: Navigate to the previously viewed page.\n`go_forward`: Navigate to the next page (if a previous 'go_back' action was performed).\n\nCompletion Action:\n`stop [answer]`: Issue this action when you believe the task is complete. If the objective is to find a text-based answer, provide the answer in the bracket. If you believe the task is impossible to complete, provide the answer as \"N/A\" in the bracket.\n\nHomepage:\nIf you want to visit other websites, check out the homepage at http://homepage.com. It has a list of websites you can visit.\n\nTo be successful, it is very important to follow the following rules:\n1. You should only issue an action that is valid given the current observation\n2. You should only issue one action at a time.\n3. You should follow the examples to reason step by step and then issue the next action.\n4. You are strictly forbidden from issuing a goto action to a URL that is not on the homepage.\n5. Generate the action in the correct format. Start by reasoning about the current situation. End with \"In summary, the next action I will perform is\" phrase, followed by action inside ``````. For example, \"Let's think step-by-step. Given the current state, I need to click on the like button which has id 1234. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```click [1234]```\".\n6. Issue stop action when you think you have achieved the objective. Don't generate anything after stop. \n\nHere are some example outputs for some random tasks:\n1. Let's think step-by-step. This page list the information of HP Inkjet Fax Machine, which is the product identified in the objective. Its price is $279.49. I think I have achieved the objective. I will issue the stop action with the answer. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```stop [$279.49]```\n2. Let's think step-by-step. This page has a search box whose ID is [164]. According to the nominatim rule of openstreetmap, I can search for the restaurants near a location by \"restaurants near\". I can submit my typing by pressing the Enter afterwards. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```type [164] [restaurants near CMU] [1]```\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\nOBSERVATION:\nTab 0 (current): Projects · Dashboard · GitLab\n\n[2584] RootWebArea 'Projects · Dashboard · GitLab' focused: True\n\t[2858] link 'Skip to content'\n\t[2989] link 'Dashboard'\n\t[3080] button '' hasPopup: menu expanded: False\n\t[4492] textbox 'Search GitLab' required: False\n\t[4459] generic 'Use the shortcut key / to start a search'\n\t[3087] link 'Create new...'\n\t[3089] link 'Issues'\n\t\t[3997] generic '13 assigned issues'\n\t[3090] link 'Merge requests'\n\t\t[3999] generic '9 merge requests'\n\t[3092] link 'To-Do List'\n\t\t[4015] generic 'Todos count'\n\t\t\t[4480] StaticText '6'\n\t[3093] link 'Help'\n\t[3095] link 'Byte BlazeByte Blaze'\n\t\t[4049] img 'Byte BlazeByte Blaze'\n\t[2590] main ''\n\t\t[2591] alert '' live: assertive atomic: True relevant: additions text\n\t\t\t[2962] button 'Dismiss'\n\t\t\t[2592] alert '' live: assertive atomic: True relevant: additions text\n\t\t\t\t[3101] StaticText 'You pushed to'\n\t\t\t\t[3102] strong 'byteblaze-main-patch-95246'\n\t\t\t\t\t[4087] link 'byteblaze-main-patch-95246'\n\t\t\t\t[3107] link 'Software Architecture Group / Game Development Project'\n\t\t\t\t[2594] time 'Sep 17, 2024 8:10pm PDT'\n\t\t\t\t\t[4092] StaticText '1 hour ago'\n\t\t\t\t[3109] link 'Create merge request'\n\t\t[2963] heading 'Projects'\n\t\t[2966] link 'New project'\n\t\t[3112] link 'Yours 61'\n\t\t[3113] link 'Starred 6'\n\t\t[3114] link 'Explore'\n\t\t[3115] link 'Topics'\n\t\t[2973] searchbox 'Filter by name'\n\t\t[3048] button 'Last created'\n\t\t[3159] link 'All'\n\t\t[3160] link 'Personal'\n\t\t[3161] link 'G'\n\t\t[3163] heading 'Software Architecture Group / Game Development Project'\n\t\t\t[3166] link 'Software Architecture Group / Game Development Project'\n\t\t[3164] generic 'Public - The project can be accessed without any authentication.'\n\t\t[3172] StaticText 'Owner'\n\t\t[3183] link '0'\n\t\t[3184] link '0'\n\t\t[3185] link '0'\n\t\t[3186] link '0'\n\t\t[3195] StaticText 'Updated '\n\t\t[2608] time 'Sep 17, 2024 8:06pm PDT'\n\t\t\t[3196] StaticText '1 hour ago'\n\t\t[3197] link 'M'\n\t\t[3199] heading 'Software Architecture Group / My Private Project'\n\t\t\t[3202] link 'Software Architecture Group / My Private Project'\n\t\t[3200] generic 'Private - Project access must be granted explicitly to each user.

        "content": "You are an autonomous intelligent agent tasked with navigating a web browser. You will be given web-based tasks. These tasks will be accomplished through the use of specific actions you can issue.\n\nHere's the information you'll have:\nThe user's objective: This is the task you're trying to complete.\nThe current web page's accessibility tree: This is a simplified representation of the webpage, providing key information.\nThe current web page's URL: This is the page you're currently navigating.\nThe open tabs: These are the tabs you have open.\nThe previous actions: These are all the action you have performed. It may be helpful to track your progress.\n\nThe actions you can perform fall into several categories:\n\nPage Operation Actions:\n`click [id]`: This action clicks on an element with a specific id on the webpage.\n`type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]`: Use this to type the content into the field with id. By default, the \"Enter\" key is pressed after typing unless press_enter_after is set to 0.\n`hover [id]`: Hover over an element with id.\n`press [key_comb]`:  Simulates the pressing of a key combination on the keyboard (e.g., Ctrl+v).\n`scroll [down|up]`: Scroll the page up or down.\n\nTab Management Actions:\n`new_tab`: Open a new, empty browser tab.\n`tab_focus [tab_index]`: Switch the browser's focus to a specific tab using its index.\n`close_tab`: Close the currently active tab.\n\nURL Navigation Actions:\n`goto [url]`: Navigate to a specific URL.\n`go_back`: Navigate to the previously viewed page.\n`go_forward`: Navigate to the next page (if a previous 'go_back' action was performed).\n\nCompletion Action:\n`stop [answer]`: Issue this action when you believe the task is complete. If the objective is to find a text-based answer, provide the answer in the bracket. If you believe the task is impossible to complete, provide the answer as \"N/A\" in the bracket.\n\nHomepage:\nIf you want to visit other websites, check out the homepage at http://homepage.com. It has a list of websites you can visit.\n\nTo be successful, it is very important to follow the following rules:\n1. You should only issue an action that is valid given the current observation\n2. You should only issue one action at a time.\n3. You should follow the examples to reason step by step and then issue the next action.\n4. You are strictly forbidden from issuing a goto action to a URL that is not on the homepage.\n5. Generate the action in the correct format. Start by reasoning about the current situation. End with \"In summary, the next action I will perform is\" phrase, followed by action inside ``````. For example, \"Let's think step-by-step. Given the current state, I need to click on the like button which has id 1234. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```click [1234]```\".\n6. Issue stop action when you think you have achieved the objective. Don't generate anything after stop. \n\nHere are some example outputs for some random tasks:\n1. Let's think step-by-step. This page list the information of HP Inkjet Fax Machine, which is the product identified in the objective. Its price is $279.49. I think I have achieved the objective. I will issue the stop action with the answer. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```stop [$279.49]```\n2. Let's think step-by-step. This page has a search box whose ID is [164]. According to the nominatim rule of openstreetmap, I can search for the restaurants near a location by \"restaurants near\". I can submit my typing by pressing the Enter afterwards. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```type [164] [restaurants near CMU] [1]```"

    "prompt": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\nYou are an autonomous intelligent agent tasked with navigating a web browser. You will be given web-based tasks. These tasks will be accomplished through the use of specific actions you can issue.\n\nHere's the information you'll have:\nThe user's objective: This is the task you're trying to complete.\nThe current web page's accessibility tree: This is a simplified representation of the webpage, providing key information.\nThe current web page's URL: This is the page you're currently navigating.\nThe open tabs: These are the tabs you have open.\nThe previous actions: These are all the action you have performed. It may be helpful to track your progress.\n\nThe actions you can perform fall into several categories:\n\nPage Operation Actions:\n`click [id]`: This action clicks on an element with a specific id on the webpage.\n`type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]`: Use this to type the content into the field with id. By default, the \"Enter\" key is pressed after typing unless press_enter_after is set to 0.\n`hover [id]`: Hover over an element with id.\n`press [key_comb]`:  Simulates the pressing of a key combination on the keyboard (e.g., Ctrl+v).\n`scroll [down|up]`: Scroll the page up or down.\n\nTab Management Actions:\n`new_tab`: Open a new, empty browser tab.\n`tab_focus [tab_index]`: Switch the browser's focus to a specific tab using its index.\n`close_tab`: Close the currently active tab.\n\nURL Navigation Actions:\n`goto [url]`: Navigate to a specific URL.\n`go_back`: Navigate to the previously viewed page.\n`go_forward`: Navigate to the next page (if a previous 'go_back' action was performed).\n\nCompletion Action:\n`stop [answer]`: Issue this action when you believe the task is complete. If the objective is to find a text-based answer, provide the answer in the bracket. If you believe the task is impossible to complete, provide the answer as \"N/A\" in the bracket.\n\nHomepage:\nIf you want to visit other websites, check out the homepage at http://homepage.com. It has a list of websites you can visit.\n\nTo be successful, it is very important to follow the following rules:\n1. You should only issue an action that is valid given the current observation\n2. You should only issue one action at a time.\n3. You should follow the examples to reason step by step and then issue the next action.\n4. You are strictly forbidden from issuing a goto action to a URL that is not on the homepage.\n5. Generate the action in the correct format. Start by reasoning about the current situation. End with \"In summary, the next action I will perform is\" phrase, followed by action inside ``````. For example, \"Let's think step-by-step. Given the current state, I need to click on the like button which has id 1234. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```click [1234]```\".\n6. Issue stop action when you think you have achieved the objective. Don't generate anything after stop. \n\nHere are some example outputs for some random tasks:\n1. Let's think step-by-step. This page list the information of HP Inkjet Fax Machine, which is the product identified in the objective. Its price is $279.49. I think I have achieved the objective. I will issue the stop action with the answer. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```stop [$279.49]```\n2. Let's think step-by-step. This page has a search box whose ID is [164]. According to the nominatim rule of openstreetmap, I can search for the restaurants near a location by \"restaurants near\". I can submit my typing by pressing the Enter afterwards. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```type [164] [restaurants near CMU] [1]```\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\nOBSERVATION:\nTab 0 (current): Projects · Dashboard · GitLab\n\n[2584] RootWebArea 'Projects · Dashboard · GitLab' focused: True\n\t[2858] link 'Skip to content'\n\t[2989] link 'Dashboard'\n\t[3080] button '' hasPopup: menu expanded: False\n\t[4492] textbox 'Search GitLab' required: False\n\t[4459] generic 'Use the shortcut key / to start a search'\n\t[3087] link 'Create new...'\n\t[3089] link 'Issues'\n\t\t[3997] generic '13 assigned issues'\n\t[3090] link 'Merge requests'\n\t\t[3999] generic '9 merge requests'\n\t[3092] link 'To-Do List'\n\t\t[4015] generic 'Todos count'\n\t\t\t[4480] StaticText '6'\n\t[3093] link 'Help'\n\t[3095] link 'Byte BlazeByte Blaze'\n\t\t[4049] img 'Byte BlazeByte Blaze'\n\t[2590] main ''\n\t\t[2591] alert '' live: assertive atomic: True relevant: additions text\n\t\t\t[2962] button 'Dismiss'\n\t\t\t[2592] alert '' live: assertive atomic: True relevant: additions text\n\t\t\t\t[3101] StaticText 'You pushed to'\n\t\t\t\t[3102] strong 'byteblaze-main-patch-95246'\n\t\t\t\t\t[4087] link 'byteblaze-main-patch-95246'\n\t\t\t\t[3107] link 'Software Architecture Group / Game Development Project'\n\t\t\t\t[2594] time 'Sep 17, 2024 8:10pm PDT'\n\t\t\t\t\t[4092] StaticText '1 hour ago'\n\t\t\t\t[3109] link 'Create merge request'\n\t\t[2963] heading 'Projects'\n\t\t[2966] link 'New project'\n\t\t[3112] link 'Yours 61'\n\t\t[3113] link 'Starred 6'\n\t\t[3114] link 'Explore'\n\t\t[3115] link 'Topics'\n\t\t[2973] searchbox 'Filter by name'\n\t\t[3048] button 'Last created'\n\t\t[3159] link 'All'\n\t\t[3160] link 'Personal'\n\t\t[3161] link 'G'\n\t\t[3163] heading 'Software Architecture Group / Game Development Project'\n\t\t\t[3166] link 'Software Architecture Group / Game Development Project'\n\t\t[3164] generic 'Public - The project can be accessed without any authentication.'\n\t\t[3172] StaticText 'Owner'\n\t\t[3183] link '0'\n\t\t[3184] link '0'\n\t\t[3185] link '0'\n\t\t[3186] link '0'\n\t\t[3195] StaticText 'Updated '\n\t\t[2608] time 'Sep 17, 2024 8:06pm PDT'\n\t\t\t[3196] StaticText '1 hour ago'\n\t\t[3197] link 'M'\n\t\t[3199] heading 'Software Architecture Group / My Private Project'\n\t\t\t[3202] link 'Software Architecture Group / My Private Project'\n\t\t[3200] generic 'Private - Project access must be granted explicitly to each user.

        "content": "You are an autonomous intelligent agent tasked with navigating a web browser. You will be given web-based tasks. These tasks will be accomplished through the use of specific actions you can issue.\n\nHere's the information you'll have:\nThe user's objective: This is the task you're trying to complete.\nThe current web page's accessibility tree: This is a simplified representation of the webpage, providing key information.\nThe current web page's URL: This is the page you're currently navigating.\nThe open tabs: These are the tabs you have open.\nThe previous actions: These are all the action you have performed. It may be helpful to track your progress.\n\nThe actions you can perform fall into several categories:\n\nPage Operation Actions:\n`click [id]`: This action clicks on an element with a specific id on the webpage.\n`type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]`: Use this to type the content into the field with id. By default, the \"Enter\" key is pressed after typing unless press_enter_after is set to 0.\n`hover [id]`: Hover over an element with id.\n`press [key_comb]`:  Simulates the pressing of a key combination on the keyboard (e.g., Ctrl+v).\n`scroll [down|up]`: Scroll the page up or down.\n\nTab Management Actions:\n`new_tab`: Open a new, empty browser tab.\n`tab_focus [tab_index]`: Switch the browser's focus to a specific tab using its index.\n`close_tab`: Close the currently active tab.\n\nURL Navigation Actions:\n`goto [url]`: Navigate to a specific URL.\n`go_back`: Navigate to the previously viewed page.\n`go_forward`: Navigate to the next page (if a previous 'go_back' action was performed).\n\nCompletion Action:\n`stop [answer]`: Issue this action when you believe the task is complete. If the objective is to find a text-based answer, provide the answer in the bracket. If you believe the task is impossible to complete, provide the answer as \"N/A\" in the bracket.\n\nHomepage:\nIf you want to visit other websites, check out the homepage at http://homepage.com. It has a list of websites you can visit.\n\nTo be successful, it is very important to follow the following rules:\n1. You should only issue an action that is valid given the current observation\n2. You should only issue one action at a time.\n3. You should follow the examples to reason step by step and then issue the next action.\n4. You are strictly forbidden from issuing a goto action to a URL that is not on the homepage.\n5. Generate the action in the correct format. Start by reasoning about the current situation. End with \"In summary, the next action I will perform is\" phrase, followed by action inside ``````. For example, \"Let's think step-by-step. Given the current state, I need to click on the like button which has id 1234. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```click [1234]```\".\n6. Issue stop action when you think you have achieved the objective. Don't generate anything after stop. \n\nHere are some example outputs for some random tasks:\n1. Let's think step-by-step. This page list the information of HP Inkjet Fax Machine, which is the product identified in the objective. Its price is $279.49. I think I have achieved the objective. I will issue the stop action with the answer. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```stop [$279.49]```\n2. Let's think step-by-step. This page has a search box whose ID is [164]. According to the nominatim rule of openstreetmap, I can search for the restaurants near a location by \"restaurants near\". I can submit my typing by pressing the Enter afterwards. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```type [164] [restaurants near CMU] [1]```"

These tasks will be accomplished through the use of specific actions you can issue.\n\nHere's the information you'll have:\nThe user's objective: This is the task you're trying to complete.\nThe current web page's accessibility tree: This is a simplified representation of the webpage, providing key information.\nThe current web page's URL: This is the page you're currently navigating.\nThe open tabs: These are the tabs you have open.\nThe previous actions: These are all the action you have performed. It may be helpful to track your progress.\n\nThe actions you can perform fall into several categories:\n\nPage Operation Actions:\n`click [id]`: This action clicks on an element with a specific id on the webpage.\n`type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]`: Use this to type the content into the field with id. By default, the \"Enter\" key is pressed after typing unless press_enter_after is set to 0.\n`hover [id]`: Hover over an element with id.\n`press [key_comb]`:  Simulates the pressing of a key combination on the keyboard (e.g., Ctrl+v).\n`scroll [down|up]`: Scroll the page up or down.\n\nTab Management Actions:\n`new_tab`: Open a new, empty browser tab.\n`tab_focus [tab_index]`: Switch the browser's focus to a specific tab using its index.\n`close_tab`: Close the currently active tab.\n\nURL Navigation Actions:\n`goto [url]`: Navigate to a specific URL.\n`go_back`: Navigate to the previously viewed page.\n`go_forward`: Navigate to the next page (if a previous 'go_back' action was performed).\n\nCompletion Action:\n`stop [answer]`: Issue this action when you believe the task is complete. If the objective is to find a text-based answer, provide the answer in the bracket. If you believe the task is impossible to complete, provide the answer as \"N/A\" in the bracket.\n\nHomepage:\nIf you want to visit other websites, check out the homepage at http://homepage.com. It has a list of websites you can visit.\n\nTo be successful, it is very important to follow the following rules:\n1. You should only issue an action that is valid given the current observation\n2. You should only issue one action at a time.\n3. You should follow the examples to reason step by step and then issue the next action.\n4. You are strictly forbidden from issuing a goto action to a URL that is not on the homepage.\n5. Generate the action in the correct format. Start by reasoning about the current situation. End with \"In summary, the next action I will perform is\" phrase, followed by action inside ``````. For example, \"Let's think step-by-step. Given the current state, I need to click on the like button which has id 1234. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```click [1234]```\".\n6. Issue stop action when you think you have achieved the objective. Don't generate anything after stop. \n\nHere are some example outputs for some random tasks:\n1. Let's think step-by-step. This page list the information of HP Inkjet Fax Machine, which is the product identified in the objective. Its price is $279.49. I think I have achieved the objective. I will issue the stop action with the answer. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```stop [$279.49]```\n2. Let's think step-by-step. This page has a search box whose ID is [164]. According to the nominatim rule of openstreetmap, I can search for the restaurants near a location by \"restaurants near\". I can submit my typing by pressing the Enter afterwards. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```type [164] [restaurants near CMU] [1]```\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\nOBSERVATION:\nTab 0 (current): Software Architecture Group / Documentation Project · GitLab\n\n[4499] RootWebArea 'Software Architecture Group / Documentation Project · GitLab' focused: True\n\t[4560] link 'Skip to content'\n\t[4746] link 'Dashboard'\n\t[4936] button '' hasPopup: menu expanded: False\n\t[6219] textbox 'Search GitLab' required: False\n\t[6009] generic 'Use the shortcut key / to start a search'\n\t[4943] link 'Create new...'\n\t[4945] link 'Issues'\n\t\t[5427] generic '13 assigned issues'\n\t[4946] link 'Merge requests'\n\t\t[5429] generic '9 merge requests'\n\t[4948] link 'To-Do List'\n\t\t[5445] generic 'Todos count'\n\t\t\t[6030] StaticText '6'\n\t[4949] link 'Help'\n\t[4951] link 'Byte BlazeByte Blaze'\n\t\t[5479] img 'Byte BlazeByte Blaze'\n\t[4561] complementary 'Project navigation'\n\t\t[4781] listitem 'Documentation Project'\n\t\t\t[4953] link 'Documentation Project'\n\t\t[4954] link 'Project information'\n\t\t[4956] link 'Repository'\n\t\t[4958] link 'Issues'\n\t\t\t[5585] StaticText '0'\n\t\t[4960] link 'Merge requests'\n\t\t[4962] link 'CI/CD'\n\t\t[4964] link 'Security & Compliance'\n\t\t[4966] link 'Deployments'\n\t\t[4968] link 'Packages and registries'\n\t\t[4970] link 'Infrastructure'\n\t\t[4972] link 'Monitor'\n\t\t[4974] link 'Analytics'\n\t\t[4976] link 'Wiki'\n\t\t[4978] link 'Snippets'\n\t\t[4980] link 'Settings'\n\t\t[4701] button 'Collapse sidebar'\n\t[4565] alert '' live: assertive atomic: True relevant: additions text\n\t\t[4569] button 'Dismiss'\n\t\t[4570] alert '' live: assertive atomic: True relevant: additions text\n\t\t\t[4814] StaticText \"You can't push or pull repositories using SSH until you add an SSH key to your profile.\"\n\t\t\t[4815] link 'Add SSH key'\n\t\t\t[4816] button \"Don't show again\"\n\t[4566] alert '' live: assertive atomic: True relevant: additions text\n\t\t[4572] button 'Dismiss'\n\t\t[4573] alert '' live: assertive atomic: True relevant: additions text\n\t\t\t[4822] StaticText 'The Auto DevOps pipeline has been enabled and will be used if no alternative CI configuration file is found.'\n\t\t\t[4824] StaticText 'Container registry is not enabled on this GitLab instance.

End with \"In summary, the next action I will perform is\" phrase, followed by action inside ``````. For example, \"Let's think step-by-step. Given the current state, I need to click on the like button which has id 1234. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```click [1234]```\".\n6. Issue stop action when you think you have achieved the objective. Don't generate anything after stop. \n\nHere are some example outputs for some random tasks:\n1. Let's think step-by-step. This page list the information of HP Inkjet Fax Machine, which is the product identified in the objective. Its price is $279.49. I think I have achieved the objective. I will issue the stop action with the answer. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```stop [$279.49]```\n2. Let's think step-by-step. This page has a search box whose ID is [164]. According to the nominatim rule of openstreetmap, I can search for the restaurants near a location by \"restaurants near\". I can submit my typing by pressing the Enter afterwards. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```type [164] [restaurants near CMU] [1]```"

These tasks will be accomplished through the use of specific actions you can issue.\n\nHere's the information you'll have:\nThe user's objective: This is the task you're trying to complete.\nThe current web page's accessibility tree: This is a simplified representation of the webpage, providing key information.\nThe current web page's URL: This is the page you're currently navigating.\nThe open tabs: These are the tabs you have open.\nThe previous actions: These are all the action you have performed. It may be helpful to track your progress.\n\nThe actions you can perform fall into several categories:\n\nPage Operation Actions:\n`click [id]`: This action clicks on an element with a specific id on the webpage.\n`type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]`: Use this to type the content into the field with id. By default, the \"Enter\" key is pressed after typing unless press_enter_after is set to 0.\n`hover [id]`: Hover over an element with id.\n`press [key_comb]`:  Simulates the pressing of a key combination on the keyboard (e.g., Ctrl+v).\n`scroll [down|up]`: Scroll the page up or down.\n\nTab Management Actions:\n`new_tab`: Open a new, empty browser tab.\n`tab_focus [tab_index]`: Switch the browser's focus to a specific tab using its index.\n`close_tab`: Close the currently active tab.\n\nURL Navigation Actions:\n`goto [url]`: Navigate to a specific URL.\n`go_back`: Navigate to the previously viewed page.\n`go_forward`: Navigate to the next page (if a previous 'go_back' action was performed).\n\nCompletion Action:\n`stop [answer]`: Issue this action when you believe the task is complete. If the objective is to find a text-based answer, provide the answer in the bracket. If you believe the task is impossible to complete, provide the answer as \"N/A\" in the bracket.\n\nHomepage:\nIf you want to visit other websites, check out the homepage at http://homepage.com. It has a list of websites you can visit.\n\nTo be successful, it is very important to follow the following rules:\n1. You should only issue an action that is valid given the current observation\n2. You should only issue one action at a time.\n3. You should follow the examples to reason step by step and then issue the next action.\n4. You are strictly forbidden from issuing a goto action to a URL that is not on the homepage.\n5. Generate the action in the correct format. Start by reasoning about the current situation. End with \"In summary, the next action I will perform is\" phrase, followed by action inside ``````. For example, \"Let's think step-by-step. Given the current state, I need to click on the like button which has id 1234. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```click [1234]```\".\n6. Issue stop action when you think you have achieved the objective. Don't generate anything after stop. \n\nHere are some example outputs for some random tasks:\n1. Let's think step-by-step. This page list the information of HP Inkjet Fax Machine, which is the product identified in the objective. Its price is $279.49. I think I have achieved the objective. I will issue the stop action with the answer. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```stop [$279.49]```\n2. Let's think step-by-step. This page has a search box whose ID is [164]. According to the nominatim rule of openstreetmap, I can search for the restaurants near a location by \"restaurants near\". I can submit my typing by pressing the Enter afterwards. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```type [164] [restaurants near CMU] [1]```\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\nOBSERVATION:\nTab 0 (current): General · Settings · Software Architecture Group / Documentation Project · GitLab\n\n[6314] RootWebArea 'General · Settings · Software Architecture Group / Documentation Project · GitLab' focused: True\n\t[6399] link 'Skip to content'\n\t[6568] link 'Dashboard'\n\t[6686] button '' hasPopup: menu expanded: False\n\t[8322] textbox 'Search GitLab' required: False\n\t[8022] generic 'Use the shortcut key / to start a search'\n\t[6693] link 'Create new...'\n\t[6695] link 'Issues'\n\t\t[7107] generic '13 assigned issues'\n\t[6696] link 'Merge requests'\n\t\t[7109] generic '9 merge requests'\n\t[6698] link 'To-Do List'\n\t\t[7125] generic 'Todos count'\n\t[6699] link 'Help'\n\t[6701] link 'Byte BlazeByte Blaze'\n\t\t[7159] img 'Byte BlazeByte Blaze'\n\t[6400] complementary 'Project navigation'\n\t\t[6603] listitem 'Documentation Project'\n\t\t\t[6703] link 'Documentation Project'\n\t\t[6704] link 'Project information'\n\t\t[6706] link 'Repository'\n\t\t[6708] link 'Issues'\n\t\t[6710] link 'Merge requests'\n\t\t[6712] link 'CI/CD'\n\t\t[6714] link 'Security & Compliance'\n\t\t[6716] link 'Deployments'\n\t\t[6718] link 'Packages and registries'\n\t\t[6720] link 'Infrastructure'\n\t\t[6722] link 'Monitor'\n\t\t[6724] link 'Analytics'\n\t\t[6726] link 'Wiki'\n\t\t[6728] link 'Snippets'\n\t\t[6730] link 'Settings'\n\t\t[8098] link 'General'\n\t\t[8099] link 'Integrations'\n\t\t[8100] link 'Webhooks'\n\t\t[8101] link 'Access Tokens'\n\t\t[8102] link 'Repository'\n\t\t[8103] link 'Merge requests'\n\t\t[8104] link 'CI/CD'\n\t\t[8105] link 'Packages and registries'\n\t\t[8106] link 'Monitor'\n\t\t[8107] link 'Usage Quotas'\n\t\t[6539] button 'Collapse sidebar'\n\t[6404] navigation 'Breadcrumbs'\n\t\t[6747] link 'Software Architecture Group'\n\t\t[6749] link 'Documentation Project'\n\t\t[6751] link 'General Settings'\n\t[6320] main ''\n\t\t[6546] searchbox 'Search page'\n\t\t[6651] heading 'Naming, topics, avatar'\n\t\t[6652] button 'Collapse'\n\t\t[6755] StaticText 'Update your project name, topics, description, and avatar.'\n\t\t[6658] group ''\n\t\t\t[8108] StaticText 'Project name'\n\t\t\t[7489] textbox 'Project name' required: False\n\t\t\t\t[8344] StaticText 'Documentation Project'\n\t\t\t[8110] StaticText 'Project ID'\n\t\t\t[7491] textbox '' required: False\n\t\t\t\t[8345] StaticText '237'\n\t\t\t[8112] StaticText 'Topics'\n\t\t\t[8346] listbox '' multiselectable: False orientation: horizontal required: False\n\t\t\t\t[8347] textbox 'Search for topic' required: False\n\t\t\t[8117] StaticText 'Project description (optional)'\n\t\t\t[7498] textbox 'Project description (optional)' required: False\n\t\t[7499] StaticText 'Repository size limit (MB)'\n\t\t[6761] spinbutton 'Repository size limit (MB)' disabled: True required: False valuemin: 0 valuemax: 0 valuetext: \n\t\t[7506] StaticText 'Want to use this feature for free?'\n\t\t[7507] StaticText'Read more about the '\n\t\t[7508] link 'Registration Features Program'\n\t\t[7509] StaticText '.'\n\t\t[7510] StaticText 'D'\n\t\t[6772] StaticText 'Project avatar'\n\t\t[6766] button 'Choose file…'\n\t\t[6768] StaticText 'No file chosen.'\n\t\t[6778] StaticText 'Max file size is 200 KB.'\n\t\t[6662] button 'Save changes' disabled: True\n\t\t[6663] heading 'Visibility, project features, permissions'\n\t\t[6664] button 'Expand'\n\t\t[6784] StaticText 'Choose visibility level, enable/disable project features and their permissions, disable email notifications, and show default award emoji.'\n\t\t[7523] StaticText 'Project visibility'\n\t\t[7525] StaticText 'Manage who can see the project in the public access directory.

        "content": "You are an autonomous intelligent agent tasked with navigating a web browser. You will be given web-based tasks. These tasks will be accomplished through the use of specific actions you can issue.\n\nHere's the information you'll have:\nThe user's objective: This is the task you're trying to complete.\nThe current web page's accessibility tree: This is a simplified representation of the webpage, providing key information.\nThe current web page's URL: This is the page you're currently navigating.\nThe open tabs: These are the tabs you have open.\nThe previous actions: These are all the action you have performed. It may be helpful to track your progress.\n\nThe actions you can perform fall into several categories:\n\nPage Operation Actions:\n`click [id]`: This action clicks on an element with a specific id on the webpage.\n`type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]`: Use this to type the content into the field with id. By default, the \"Enter\" key is pressed after typing unless press_enter_after is set to 0.\n`hover [id]`: Hover over an element with id.\n`press [key_comb]`:  Simulates the pressing of a key combination on the keyboard (e.g., Ctrl+v).\n`scroll [down|up]`: Scroll the page up or down.\n\nTab Management Actions:\n`new_tab`: Open a new, empty browser tab.\n`tab_focus [tab_index]`: Switch the browser's focus to a specific tab using its index.\n`close_tab`: Close the currently active tab.\n\nURL Navigation Actions:\n`goto [url]`: Navigate to a specific URL.\n`go_back`: Navigate to the previously viewed page.\n`go_forward`: Navigate to the next page (if a previous 'go_back' action was performed).\n\nCompletion Action:\n`stop [answer]`: Issue this action when you believe the task is complete. If the objective is to find a text-based answer, provide the answer in the bracket. If you believe the task is impossible to complete, provide the answer as \"N/A\" in the bracket.\n\nHomepage:\nIf you want to visit other websites, check out the homepage at http://homepage.com. It has a list of websites you can visit.\n\nTo be successful, it is very important to follow the following rules:\n1. You should only issue an action that is valid given the current observation\n2. You should only issue one action at a time.\n3. You should follow the examples to reason step by step and then issue the next action.\n4. You are strictly forbidden from issuing a goto action to a URL that is not on the homepage.\n5. Generate the action in the correct format. Start by reasoning about the current situation. End with \"In summary, the next action I will perform is\" phrase, followed by action inside ``````. For example, \"Let's think step-by-step. Given the current state, I need to click on the like button which has id 1234. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```click [1234]```\".\n6. Issue stop action when you think you have achieved the objective. Don't generate anything after stop. \n\nHere are some example outputs for some random tasks:\n1. Let's think step-by-step. This page list the information of HP Inkjet Fax Machine, which is the product identified in the objective. Its price is $279.49. I think I have achieved the objective. I will issue the stop action with the answer. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```stop [$279.49]```\n2. Let's think step-by-step. This page has a search box whose ID is [164]. According to the nominatim rule of openstreetmap, I can search for the restaurants near a location by \"restaurants near\". I can submit my typing by pressing the Enter afterwards. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```type [164] [restaurants near CMU] [1]```"

    "prompt": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\nYou are an autonomous intelligent agent tasked with navigating a web browser. You will be given web-based tasks. These tasks will be accomplished through the use of specific actions you can issue.\n\nHere's the information you'll have:\nThe user's objective: This is the task you're trying to complete.\nThe current web page's accessibility tree: This is a simplified representation of the webpage, providing key information.\nThe current web page's URL: This is the page you're currently navigating.\nThe open tabs: These are the tabs you have open.\nThe previous actions: These are all the action you have performed. It may be helpful to track your progress.\n\nThe actions you can perform fall into several categories:\n\nPage Operation Actions:\n`click [id]`: This action clicks on an element with a specific id on the webpage.\n`type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]`: Use this to type the content into the field with id. By default, the \"Enter\" key is pressed after typing unless press_enter_after is set to 0.\n`hover [id]`: Hover over an element with id.\n`press [key_comb]`:  Simulates the pressing of a key combination on the keyboard (e.g., Ctrl+v).\n`scroll [down|up]`: Scroll the page up or down.\n\nTab Management Actions:\n`new_tab`: Open a new, empty browser tab.\n`tab_focus [tab_index]`: Switch the browser's focus to a specific tab using its index.\n`close_tab`: Close the currently active tab.\n\nURL Navigation Actions:\n`goto [url]`: Navigate to a specific URL.\n`go_back`: Navigate to the previously viewed page.\n`go_forward`: Navigate to the next page (if a previous 'go_back' action was performed).\n\nCompletion Action:\n`stop [answer]`: Issue this action when you believe the task is complete. If the objective is to find a text-based answer, provide the answer in the bracket. If you believe the task is impossible to complete, provide the answer as \"N/A\" in the bracket.\n\nHomepage:\nIf you want to visit other websites, check out the homepage at http://homepage.com. It has a list of websites you can visit.\n\nTo be successful, it is very important to follow the following rules:\n1. You should only issue an action that is valid given the current observation\n2. You should only issue one action at a time.\n3. You should follow the examples to reason step by step and then issue the next action.\n4. You are strictly forbidden from issuing a goto action to a URL that is not on the homepage.\n5. Generate the action in the correct format. Start by reasoning about the current situation. End with \"In summary, the next action I will perform is\" phrase, followed by action inside ``````. For example, \"Let's think step-by-step. Given the current state, I need to click on the like button which has id 1234. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```click [1234]```\".\n6. Issue stop action when you think you have achieved the objective. Don't generate anything after stop. \n\nHere are some example outputs for some random tasks:\n1. Let's think step-by-step. This page list the information of HP Inkjet Fax Machine, which is the product identified in the objective. Its price is $279.49. I think I have achieved the objective. I will issue the stop action with the answer. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```stop [$279.49]```\n2. Let's think step-by-step. This page has a search box whose ID is [164]. According to the nominatim rule of openstreetmap, I can search for the restaurants near a location by \"restaurants near\". I can submit my typing by pressing the Enter afterwards. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```type [164] [restaurants near CMU] [1]```\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\nOBSERVATION:\nTab 0 (current): General · Settings · Software Architecture Group / Documentation Project · GitLab\n\n[6314] RootWebArea 'General · Settings · Software Architecture Group / Documentation Project · GitLab' focused: True\n\t[6399] link 'Skip to content'\n\t[6568] link 'Dashboard'\n\t[6686] button '' hasPopup: menu expanded: False\n\t[8322] textbox 'Search GitLab' required: False\n\t[8022] generic 'Use the shortcut key / to start a search'\n\t[6693] link 'Create new...'\n\t[6695] link 'Issues'\n\t\t[7107] generic '13 assigned issues'\n\t[6696] link 'Merge requests'\n\t\t[7109] generic '9 merge requests'\n\t[6698] link 'To-Do List'\n\t\t[7125] generic 'Todos count'\n\t[6699] link 'Help'\n\t[6701] link 'Byte BlazeByte Blaze'\n\t\t[7159] img 'Byte BlazeByte Blaze'\n\t[6400] complementary 'Project navigation'\n\t\t[6603] listitem 'Documentation Project'\n\t\t\t[6703] link 'Documentation Project'\n\t\t[6704] link 'Project information'\n\t\t[6706] link 'Repository'\n\t\t[6708] link 'Issues'\n\t\t[6710] link 'Merge requests'\n\t\t[6712] link 'CI/CD'\n\t\t[6714] link 'Security & Compliance'\n\t\t[6716] link 'Deployments'\n\t\t[6718] link 'Packages and registries'\n\t\t[6720] link 'Infrastructure'\n\t\t[6722] link 'Monitor'\n\t\t[6724] link 'Analytics'\n\t\t[6726] link 'Wiki'\n\t\t[6728] link 'Snippets'\n\t\t[6730] link 'Settings'\n\t\t[8098] link 'General'\n\t\t[8099] link 'Integrations'\n\t\t[8100] link 'Webhooks'\n\t\t[8101] link 'Access Tokens'\n\t\t[8102] link 'Repository'\n\t\t[8103] link 'Merge requests'\n\t\t[8104] link 'CI/CD'\n\t\t[8105] link 'Packages and registries'\n\t\t[8106] link 'Monitor'\n\t\t[8107] link 'Usage Quotas'\n\t\t[6539] button 'Collapse sidebar'\n\t[6404] navigation 'Breadcrumbs'\n\t\t[6747] link 'Software Architecture Group'\n\t\t[6749] link 'Documentation Project'\n\t\t[6751] link 'General Settings'\n\t[6320] main ''\n\t\t[6546] searchbox 'Search page'\n\t\t[6651] heading 'Naming, topics, avatar'\n\t\t[6652] button 'Collapse'\n\t\t[6755] StaticText 'Update your project name, topics, description, and avatar.'\n\t\t[6658] group ''\n\t\t\t[8108] StaticText 'Project name'\n\t\t\t[7489] textbox 'Project name' required: False\n\t\t\t\t[8344] StaticText 'Documentation Project'\n\t\t\t[8110] StaticText 'Project ID'\n\t\t\t[7491] textbox '' required: False\n\t\t\t\t[8345] StaticText '237'\n\t\t\t[8112] StaticText 'Topics'\n\t\t\t[8346] listbox '' multiselectable: False orientation: horizontal required: False\n\t\t\t\t[8347] textbox 'Search for topic' required: False\n\t\t\t[8117] StaticText 'Project description (optional)'\n\t\t\t[7498] textbox 'Project description (optional)' required: False\n\t\t[7499] StaticText 'Repository size limit (MB)'\n\t\t[6761] spinbutton 'Repository size limit (MB)' disabled: True required: False valuemin: 0 valuemax: 0 valuetext: \n\t\t[7506] StaticText 'Want to use this feature for free?'\n\t\t[7507] StaticText'Read more about the '\n\t\t[7508] link 'Registration Features Program'\n\t\t[7509] StaticText '.'\n\t\t[7510] StaticText 'D'\n\t\t[6772] StaticText 'Project avatar'\n\t\t[6766] button 'Choose file…'\n\t\t[6768] StaticText 'No file chosen.'\n\t\t[6778] StaticText 'Max file size is 200 KB.'\n\t\t[6662] button 'Save changes' disabled: True\n\t\t[6663] heading 'Visibility, project features, permissions'\n\t\t[6664] button 'Expand'\n\t\t[6784] StaticText 'Choose visibility level, enable/disable project features and their permissions, disable email notifications, and show default award emoji.'\n\t\t[7523] StaticText 'Project visibility'\n\t\t[7525] StaticText 'Manage who can see the project in the public access directory.

        "content": "You are an autonomous intelligent agent tasked with navigating a web browser. You will be given web-based tasks. These tasks will be accomplished through the use of specific actions you can issue.\n\nHere's the information you'll have:\nThe user's objective: This is the task you're trying to complete.\nThe current web page's accessibility tree: This is a simplified representation of the webpage, providing key information.\nThe current web page's URL: This is the page you're currently navigating.\nThe open tabs: These are the tabs you have open.\nThe previous actions: These are all the action you have performed. It may be helpful to track your progress.\n\nThe actions you can perform fall into several categories:\n\nPage Operation Actions:\n`click [id]`: This action clicks on an element with a specific id on the webpage.\n`type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]`: Use this to type the content into the field with id. By default, the \"Enter\" key is pressed after typing unless press_enter_after is set to 0.\n`hover [id]`: Hover over an element with id.\n`press [key_comb]`:  Simulates the pressing of a key combination on the keyboard (e.g., Ctrl+v).\n`scroll [down|up]`: Scroll the page up or down.\n\nTab Management Actions:\n`new_tab`: Open a new, empty browser tab.\n`tab_focus [tab_index]`: Switch the browser's focus to a specific tab using its index.\n`close_tab`: Close the currently active tab.\n\nURL Navigation Actions:\n`goto [url]`: Navigate to a specific URL.\n`go_back`: Navigate to the previously viewed page.\n`go_forward`: Navigate to the next page (if a previous 'go_back' action was performed).\n\nCompletion Action:\n`stop [answer]`: Issue this action when you believe the task is complete. If the objective is to find a text-based answer, provide the answer in the bracket. If you believe the task is impossible to complete, provide the answer as \"N/A\" in the bracket.\n\nHomepage:\nIf you want to visit other websites, check out the homepage at http://homepage.com. It has a list of websites you can visit.\n\nTo be successful, it is very important to follow the following rules:\n1. You should only issue an action that is valid given the current observation\n2. You should only issue one action at a time.\n3. You should follow the examples to reason step by step and then issue the next action.\n4. You are strictly forbidden from issuing a goto action to a URL that is not on the homepage.\n5. Generate the action in the correct format. Start by reasoning about the current situation. End with \"In summary, the next action I will perform is\" phrase, followed by action inside ``````. For example, \"Let's think step-by-step. Given the current state, I need to click on the like button which has id 1234. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```click [1234]```\".\n6. Issue stop action when you think you have achieved the objective. Don't generate anything after stop. \n\nHere are some example outputs for some random tasks:\n1. Let's think step-by-step. This page list the information of HP Inkjet Fax Machine, which is the product identified in the objective. Its price is $279.49. I think I have achieved the objective. I will issue the stop action with the answer. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```stop [$279.49]```\n2. Let's think step-by-step. This page has a search box whose ID is [164]. According to the nominatim rule of openstreetmap, I can search for the restaurants near a location by \"restaurants near\". I can submit my typing by pressing the Enter afterwards. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```type [164] [restaurants near CMU] [1]```"

These tasks will be accomplished through the use of specific actions you can issue.\n\nHere's the information you'll have:\nThe user's objective: This is the task you're trying to complete.\nThe current web page's accessibility tree: This is a simplified representation of the webpage, providing key information.\nThe current web page's URL: This is the page you're currently navigating.\nThe open tabs: These are the tabs you have open.\nThe previous actions: These are all the action you have performed. It may be helpful to track your progress.\n\nThe actions you can perform fall into several categories:\n\nPage Operation Actions:\n`click [id]`: This action clicks on an element with a specific id on the webpage.\n`type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]`: Use this to type the content into the field with id. By default, the \"Enter\" key is pressed after typing unless press_enter_after is set to 0.\n`hover [id]`: Hover over an element with id.\n`press [key_comb]`:  Simulates the pressing of a key combination on the keyboard (e.g., Ctrl+v).\n`scroll [down|up]`: Scroll the page up or down.\n\nTab Management Actions:\n`new_tab`: Open a new, empty browser tab.\n`tab_focus [tab_index]`: Switch the browser's focus to a specific tab using its index.\n`close_tab`: Close the currently active tab.\n\nURL Navigation Actions:\n`goto [url]`: Navigate to a specific URL.\n`go_back`: Navigate to the previously viewed page.\n`go_forward`: Navigate to the next page (if a previous 'go_back' action was performed).\n\nCompletion Action:\n`stop [answer]`: Issue this action when you believe the task is complete. If the objective is to find a text-based answer, provide the answer in the bracket. If you believe the task is impossible to complete, provide the answer as \"N/A\" in the bracket.\n\nHomepage:\nIf you want to visit other websites, check out the homepage at http://homepage.com. It has a list of websites you can visit.\n\nTo be successful, it is very important to follow the following rules:\n1. You should only issue an action that is valid given the current observation\n2. You should only issue one action at a time.\n3. You should follow the examples to reason step by step and then issue the next action.\n4. You are strictly forbidden from issuing a goto action to a URL that is not on the homepage.\n5. Generate the action in the correct format. Start by reasoning about the current situation. End with \"In summary, the next action I will perform is\" phrase, followed by action inside ``````. For example, \"Let's think step-by-step. Given the current state, I need to click on the like button which has id 1234. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```click [1234]```\".\n6. Issue stop action when you think you have achieved the objective. Don't generate anything after stop. \n\nHere are some example outputs for some random tasks:\n1. Let's think step-by-step. This page list the information of HP Inkjet Fax Machine, which is the product identified in the objective. Its price is $279.49. I think I have achieved the objective. I will issue the stop action with the answer. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```stop [$279.49]```\n2. Let's think step-by-step. This page has a search box whose ID is [164]. According to the nominatim rule of openstreetmap, I can search for the restaurants near a location by \"restaurants near\". I can submit my typing by pressing the Enter afterwards. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```type [164] [restaurants near CMU] [1]```\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\nOBSERVATION:\nTab 0 (current): General · Settings · Software Architecture Group / Documentation Project · GitLab\n\n[6314] RootWebArea 'General · Settings · Software Architecture Group / Documentation Project · GitLab' focused: True\n\t[6399] link 'Skip to content'\n\t[6568] link 'Dashboard'\n\t[6686] button '' hasPopup: menu expanded: False\n\t[8322] textbox 'Search GitLab' required: False\n\t[8022] generic 'Use the shortcut key / to start a search'\n\t[6693] link 'Create new...'\n\t[6695] link 'Issues'\n\t\t[7107] generic '13 assigned issues'\n\t[6696] link 'Merge requests'\n\t\t[7109] generic '9 merge requests'\n\t[6698] link 'To-Do List'\n\t\t[7125] generic 'Todos count'\n\t[6699] link 'Help'\n\t[6701] link 'Byte BlazeByte Blaze'\n\t\t[7159] img 'Byte BlazeByte Blaze'\n\t[6400] complementary 'Project navigation'\n\t\t[6603] listitem 'Documentation Project'\n\t\t\t[6703] link 'Documentation Project'\n\t\t[6704] link 'Project information'\n\t\t[6706] link 'Repository'\n\t\t[6708] link 'Issues'\n\t\t[6710] link 'Merge requests'\n\t\t[6712] link 'CI/CD'\n\t\t[6714] link 'Security & Compliance'\n\t\t[6716] link 'Deployments'\n\t\t[6718] link 'Packages and registries'\n\t\t[6720] link 'Infrastructure'\n\t\t[6722] link 'Monitor'\n\t\t[6724] link 'Analytics'\n\t\t[6726] link 'Wiki'\n\t\t[6728] link 'Snippets'\n\t\t[6730] link 'Settings'\n\t\t[8098] link 'General'\n\t\t[8099] link 'Integrations'\n\t\t[8100] link 'Webhooks'\n\t\t[8101] link 'Access Tokens'\n\t\t[8102] link 'Repository'\n\t\t[8103] link 'Merge requests'\n\t\t[8104] link 'CI/CD'\n\t\t[8105] link 'Packages and registries'\n\t\t[8106] link 'Monitor'\n\t\t[8107] link 'Usage Quotas'\n\t\t[6539] button 'Collapse sidebar'\n\t[6404] navigation 'Breadcrumbs'\n\t\t[6747] link 'Software Architecture Group'\n\t\t[6749] link 'Documentation Project'\n\t\t[6751] link 'General Settings'\n\t[6320] main ''\n\t\t[6546] searchbox 'Search page'\n\t\t[6651] heading 'Naming, topics, avatar'\n\t\t[6652] button 'Collapse'\n\t\t[6755] StaticText 'Update your project name, topics, description, and avatar.'\n\t\t[6658] group ''\n\t\t\t[8108] StaticText 'Project name'\n\t\t\t[7489] textbox 'Project name' required: False\n\t\t\t\t[8344] StaticText 'Documentation Project'\n\t\t\t[8110] StaticText 'Project ID'\n\t\t\t[7491] textbox '' required: False\n\t\t\t\t[8345] StaticText '237'\n\t\t\t[8112] StaticText 'Topics'\n\t\t\t[8346] listbox '' multiselectable: False orientation: horizontal required: False\n\t\t\t\t[8347] textbox 'Search for topic' required: False\n\t\t\t[8117] StaticText 'Project description (optional)'\n\t\t\t[7498] textbox 'Project description (optional)' required: False\n\t\t[7499] StaticText 'Repository size limit (MB)'\n\t\t[6761] spinbutton 'Repository size limit (MB)' disabled: True required: False valuemin: 0 valuemax: 0 valuetext: \n\t\t[7506] StaticText 'Want to use this feature for free?'\n\t\t[7507] StaticText'Read more about the '\n\t\t[7508] link 'Registration Features Program'\n\t\t[7509] StaticText '.'\n\t\t[7510] StaticText 'D'\n\t\t[6772] StaticText 'Project avatar'\n\t\t[6766] button 'Choose file…'\n\t\t[6768] StaticText 'No file chosen.'\n\t\t[6778] StaticText 'Max file size is 200 KB.'\n\t\t[6662] button 'Save changes' disabled: True\n\t\t[6663] heading 'Visibility, project features, permissions'\n\t\t[6664] button 'Expand'\n\t\t[6784] StaticText 'Choose visibility level, enable/disable project features and their permissions, disable email notifications, and show default award emoji.'\n\t\t[7523] StaticText 'Project visibility'\n\t\t[7525] StaticText 'Manage who can see the project in the public access directory.

        "content": "You are an autonomous intelligent agent tasked with navigating a web browser. You will be given web-based tasks. These tasks will be accomplished through the use of specific actions you can issue.\n\nHere's the information you'll have:\nThe user's objective: This is the task you're trying to complete.\nThe current web page's accessibility tree: This is a simplified representation of the webpage, providing key information.\nThe current web page's URL: This is the page you're currently navigating.\nThe open tabs: These are the tabs you have open.\nThe previous actions: These are all the action you have performed. It may be helpful to track your progress.\n\nThe actions you can perform fall into several categories:\n\nPage Operation Actions:\n`click [id]`: This action clicks on an element with a specific id on the webpage.\n`type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]`: Use this to type the content into the field with id. By default, the \"Enter\" key is pressed after typing unless press_enter_after is set to 0.\n`hover [id]`: Hover over an element with id.\n`press [key_comb]`:  Simulates the pressing of a key combination on the keyboard (e.g., Ctrl+v).\n`scroll [down|up]`: Scroll the page up or down.\n\nTab Management Actions:\n`new_tab`: Open a new, empty browser tab.\n`tab_focus [tab_index]`: Switch the browser's focus to a specific tab using its index.\n`close_tab`: Close the currently active tab.\n\nURL Navigation Actions:\n`goto [url]`: Navigate to a specific URL.\n`go_back`: Navigate to the previously viewed page.\n`go_forward`: Navigate to the next page (if a previous 'go_back' action was performed).\n\nCompletion Action:\n`stop [answer]`: Issue this action when you believe the task is complete. If the objective is to find a text-based answer, provide the answer in the bracket. If you believe the task is impossible to complete, provide the answer as \"N/A\" in the bracket.\n\nHomepage:\nIf you want to visit other websites, check out the homepage at http://homepage.com. It has a list of websites you can visit.\n\nTo be successful, it is very important to follow the following rules:\n1. You should only issue an action that is valid given the current observation\n2. You should only issue one action at a time.\n3. You should follow the examples to reason step by step and then issue the next action.\n4. You are strictly forbidden from issuing a goto action to a URL that is not on the homepage.\n5. Generate the action in the correct format. Start by reasoning about the current situation. End with \"In summary, the next action I will perform is\" phrase, followed by action inside ``````. For example, \"Let's think step-by-step. Given the current state, I need to click on the like button which has id 1234. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```click [1234]```\".\n6. Issue stop action when you think you have achieved the objective. Don't generate anything after stop. \n\nHere are some example outputs for some random tasks:\n1. Let's think step-by-step. This page list the information of HP Inkjet Fax Machine, which is the product identified in the objective. Its price is $279.49. I think I have achieved the objective. I will issue the stop action with the answer. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```stop [$279.49]```\n2. Let's think step-by-step. This page has a search box whose ID is [164]. According to the nominatim rule of openstreetmap, I can search for the restaurants near a location by \"restaurants near\". I can submit my typing by pressing the Enter afterwards. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```type [164] [restaurants near CMU] [1]```"

By default, the \"Enter\" key is pressed after typing unless press_enter_after is set to 0.\n`hover [id]`: Hover over an element with id.\n`press [key_comb]`:  Simulates the pressing of a key combination on the keyboard (e.g., Ctrl+v).\n`scroll [down|up]`: Scroll the page up or down.\n\nTab Management Actions:\n`new_tab`: Open a new, empty browser tab.\n`tab_focus [tab_index]`: Switch the browser's focus to a specific tab using its index.\n`close_tab`: Close the currently active tab.\n\nURL Navigation Actions:\n`goto [url]`: Navigate to a specific URL.\n`go_back`: Navigate to the previously viewed page.\n`go_forward`: Navigate to the next page (if a previous 'go_back' action was performed).\n\nCompletion Action:\n`stop [answer]`: Issue this action when you believe the task is complete. If the objective is to find a text-based answer, provide the answer in the bracket. If you believe the task is impossible to complete, provide the answer as \"N/A\" in the bracket.\n\nHomepage:\nIf you want to visit other websites, check out the homepage at http://homepage.com. It has a list of websites you can visit.\n\nTo be successful, it is very important to follow the following rules:\n1. You should only issue an action that is valid given the current observation\n2. You should only issue one action at a time.\n3. You should follow the examples to reason step by step and then issue the next action.\n4. You are strictly forbidden from issuing a goto action to a URL that is not on the homepage.\n5. Generate the action in the correct format. Start by reasoning about the current situation. End with \"In summary, the next action I will perform is\" phrase, followed by action inside ``````. For example, \"Let's think step-by-step. Given the current state, I need to click on the like button which has id 1234. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```click [1234]```\".\n6. Issue stop action when you think you have achieved the objective. Don't generate anything after stop. \n\nHere are some example outputs for some random tasks:\n1. Let's think step-by-step. This page list the information of HP Inkjet Fax Machine, which is the product identified in the objective. Its price is $279.49. I think I have achieved the objective. I will issue the stop action with the answer. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```stop [$279.49]```\n2. Let's think step-by-step. This page has a search box whose ID is [164]. According to the nominatim rule of openstreetmap, I can search for the restaurants near a location by \"restaurants near\". I can submit my typing by pressing the Enter afterwards. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```type [164] [restaurants near CMU] [1]```\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\nOBSERVATION:\nTab 0 (current): General · Settings · Software Architecture Group / Documentation Project · GitLab\n\n[6314] RootWebArea 'General · Settings · Software Architecture Group / Documentation Project · GitLab' focused: True\n\t[6399] link 'Skip to content'\n\t[6568] link 'Dashboard'\n\t[6686] button '' hasPopup: menu expanded: False\n\t[8322] textbox 'Search GitLab' required: False\n\t[8022] generic 'Use the shortcut key / to start a search'\n\t[6693] link 'Create new...'\n\t[6695] link 'Issues'\n\t\t[7107] generic '13 assigned issues'\n\t[6696] link 'Merge requests'\n\t\t[7109] generic '9 merge requests'\n\t[6698] link 'To-Do List'\n\t\t[7125] generic 'Todos count'\n\t[6699] link 'Help'\n\t[6701] link 'Byte BlazeByte Blaze'\n\t\t[7159] img 'Byte BlazeByte Blaze'\n\t[6400] complementary 'Project navigation'\n\t\t[6603] listitem 'Documentation Project'\n\t\t\t[6703] link 'Documentation Project'\n\t\t[6704] link 'Project information'\n\t\t[6706] link 'Repository'\n\t\t[6708] link 'Issues'\n\t\t[6710] link 'Merge requests'\n\t\t[6712] link 'CI/CD'\n\t\t[6714] link 'Security & Compliance'\n\t\t[6716] link 'Deployments'\n\t\t[6718] link 'Packages and registries'\n\t\t[6720] link 'Infrastructure'\n\t\t[6722] link 'Monitor'\n\t\t[6724] link 'Analytics'\n\t\t[6726] link 'Wiki'\n\t\t[6728] link 'Snippets'\n\t\t[6730] link 'Settings'\n\t\t[8098] link 'General'\n\t\t[8099] link 'Integrations'\n\t\t[8100] link 'Webhooks'\n\t\t[8101] link 'Access Tokens'\n\t\t[8102] link 'Repository'\n\t\t[8103] link 'Merge requests'\n\t\t[8104] link 'CI/CD'\n\t\t[8105] link 'Packages and registries'\n\t\t[8106] link 'Monitor'\n\t\t[8107] link 'Usage Quotas'\n\t\t[6539] button 'Collapse sidebar'\n\t[6404] navigation 'Breadcrumbs'\n\t\t[6747] link 'Software Architecture Group'\n\t\t[6749] link 'Documentation Project'\n\t\t[6751] link 'General Settings'\n\t[6320] main ''\n\t\t[6546] searchbox 'Search page'\n\t\t[6651] heading 'Naming, topics, avatar'\n\t\t[6652] button 'Collapse'\n\t\t[6755] StaticText 'Update your project name, topics, description, and avatar.'\n\t\t[6658] group ''\n\t\t\t[8108] StaticText 'Project name'\n\t\t\t[7489] textbox 'Project name' required: False\n\t\t\t\t[8344] StaticText 'Documentation Project'\n\t\t\t[8110] StaticText 'Project ID'\n\t\t\t[7491] textbox '' required: False\n\t\t\t\t[8345] StaticText '237'\n\t\t\t[8112] StaticText 'Topics'\n\t\t\t[8346] listbox '' multiselectable: False orientation: horizontal required: False\n\t\t\t\t[8347] textbox 'Search for topic' required: False\n\t\t\t[8117] StaticText 'Project description (optional)'\n\t\t\t[7498] textbox 'Project description (optional)' required: False\n\t\t[7499] StaticText 'Repository size limit (MB)'\n\t\t[6761] spinbutton 'Repository size limit (MB)' disabled: True required: False valuemin: 0 valuemax: 0 valuetext: \n\t\t[7506] StaticText 'Want to use this feature for free?'\n\t\t[7507] StaticText'Read more about the '\n\t\t[7508] link 'Registration Features Program'\n\t\t[7509] StaticText '.'\n\t\t[7510] StaticText 'D'\n\t\t[6772] StaticText 'Project avatar'\n\t\t[6766] button 'Choose file…'\n\t\t[6768] StaticText 'No file chosen.'\n\t\t[6778] StaticText 'Max file size is 200 KB.'\n\t\t[6662] button 'Save changes' disabled: True\n\t\t[6663] heading 'Visibility, project features, permissions'\n\t\t[6664] button 'Expand'\n\t\t[6784] StaticText 'Choose visibility level, enable/disable project features and their permissions, disable email notifications, and show default award emoji.'\n\t\t[7523] StaticText 'Project visibility'\n\t\t[7525] StaticText 'Manage who can see the project in the public access directory.

        "content": "You are an autonomous intelligent agent tasked with navigating a web browser. You will be given web-based tasks. These tasks will be accomplished through the use of specific actions you can issue.\n\nHere's the information you'll have:\nThe user's objective: This is the task you're trying to complete.\nThe current web page's accessibility tree: This is a simplified representation of the webpage, providing key information.\nThe current web page's URL: This is the page you're currently navigating.\nThe open tabs: These are the tabs you have open.\nThe previous actions: These are all the action you have performed. It may be helpful to track your progress.\n\nThe actions you can perform fall into several categories:\n\nPage Operation Actions:\n`click [id]`: This action clicks on an element with a specific id on the webpage.\n`type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]`: Use this to type the content into the field with id. By default, the \"Enter\" key is pressed after typing unless press_enter_after is set to 0.\n`hover [id]`: Hover over an element with id.\n`press [key_comb]`:  Simulates the pressing of a key combination on the keyboard (e.g., Ctrl+v).\n`scroll [down|up]`: Scroll the page up or down.\n\nTab Management Actions:\n`new_tab`: Open a new, empty browser tab.\n`tab_focus [tab_index]`: Switch the browser's focus to a specific tab using its index.\n`close_tab`: Close the currently active tab.\n\nURL Navigation Actions:\n`goto [url]`: Navigate to a specific URL.\n`go_back`: Navigate to the previously viewed page.\n`go_forward`: Navigate to the next page (if a previous 'go_back' action was performed).\n\nCompletion Action:\n`stop [answer]`: Issue this action when you believe the task is complete. If the objective is to find a text-based answer, provide the answer in the bracket. If you believe the task is impossible to complete, provide the answer as \"N/A\" in the bracket.\n\nHomepage:\nIf you want to visit other websites, check out the homepage at http://homepage.com. It has a list of websites you can visit.\n\nTo be successful, it is very important to follow the following rules:\n1. You should only issue an action that is valid given the current observation\n2. You should only issue one action at a time.\n3. You should follow the examples to reason step by step and then issue the next action.\n4. You are strictly forbidden from issuing a goto action to a URL that is not on the homepage.\n5. Generate the action in the correct format. Start by reasoning about the current situation. End with \"In summary, the next action I will perform is\" phrase, followed by action inside ``````. For example, \"Let's think step-by-step. Given the current state, I need to click on the like button which has id 1234. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```click [1234]```\".\n6. Issue stop action when you think you have achieved the objective. Don't generate anything after stop. \n\nHere are some example outputs for some random tasks:\n1. Let's think step-by-step. This page list the information of HP Inkjet Fax Machine, which is the product identified in the objective. Its price is $279.49. I think I have achieved the objective. I will issue the stop action with the answer. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```stop [$279.49]```\n2. Let's think step-by-step. This page has a search box whose ID is [164]. According to the nominatim rule of openstreetmap, I can search for the restaurants near a location by \"restaurants near\". I can submit my typing by pressing the Enter afterwards. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```type [164] [restaurants near CMU] [1]```"

These tasks will be accomplished through the use of specific actions you can issue.\n\nHere's the information you'll have:\nThe user's objective: This is the task you're trying to complete.\nThe current web page's accessibility tree: This is a simplified representation of the webpage, providing key information.\nThe current web page's URL: This is the page you're currently navigating.\nThe open tabs: These are the tabs you have open.\nThe previous actions: These are all the action you have performed. It may be helpful to track your progress.\n\nThe actions you can perform fall into several categories:\n\nPage Operation Actions:\n`click [id]`: This action clicks on an element with a specific id on the webpage.\n`type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]`: Use this to type the content into the field with id. By default, the \"Enter\" key is pressed after typing unless press_enter_after is set to 0.\n`hover [id]`: Hover over an element with id.\n`press [key_comb]`:  Simulates the pressing of a key combination on the keyboard (e.g., Ctrl+v).\n`scroll [down|up]`: Scroll the page up or down.\n\nTab Management Actions:\n`new_tab`: Open a new, empty browser tab.\n`tab_focus [tab_index]`: Switch the browser's focus to a specific tab using its index.\n`close_tab`: Close the currently active tab.\n\nURL Navigation Actions:\n`goto [url]`: Navigate to a specific URL.\n`go_back`: Navigate to the previously viewed page.\n`go_forward`: Navigate to the next page (if a previous 'go_back' action was performed).\n\nCompletion Action:\n`stop [answer]`: Issue this action when you believe the task is complete. If the objective is to find a text-based answer, provide the answer in the bracket. If you believe the task is impossible to complete, provide the answer as \"N/A\" in the bracket.\n\nHomepage:\nIf you want to visit other websites, check out the homepage at http://homepage.com. It has a list of websites you can visit.\n\nTo be successful, it is very important to follow the following rules:\n1. You should only issue an action that is valid given the current observation\n2. You should only issue one action at a time.\n3. You should follow the examples to reason step by step and then issue the next action.\n4. You are strictly forbidden from issuing a goto action to a URL that is not on the homepage.\n5. Generate the action in the correct format. Start by reasoning about the current situation. End with \"In summary, the next action I will perform is\" phrase, followed by action inside ``````. For example, \"Let's think step-by-step. Given the current state, I need to click on the like button which has id 1234. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```click [1234]```\".\n6. Issue stop action when you think you have achieved the objective. Don't generate anything after stop. \n\nHere are some example outputs for some random tasks:\n1. Let's think step-by-step. This page list the information of HP Inkjet Fax Machine, which is the product identified in the objective. Its price is $279.49. I think I have achieved the objective. I will issue the stop action with the answer. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```stop [$279.49]```\n2. Let's think step-by-step. This page has a search box whose ID is [164]. According to the nominatim rule of openstreetmap, I can search for the restaurants near a location by \"restaurants near\". I can submit my typing by pressing the Enter afterwards. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```type [164] [restaurants near CMU] [1]```\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\nOBSERVATION:\nTab 0 (current): General · Settings · Software Architecture Group / Documentation Project · GitLab\n\n[6314] RootWebArea 'General · Settings · Software Architecture Group / Documentation Project · GitLab' focused: True\n\t[6399] link 'Skip to content'\n\t[6568] link 'Dashboard'\n\t[6686] button '' hasPopup: menu expanded: False\n\t[8322] textbox 'Search GitLab' required: False\n\t[8022] generic 'Use the shortcut key / to start a search'\n\t[6693] link 'Create new...'\n\t[6695] link 'Issues'\n\t\t[7107] generic '13 assigned issues'\n\t[6696] link 'Merge requests'\n\t\t[7109] generic '9 merge requests'\n\t[6698] link 'To-Do List'\n\t\t[7125] generic 'Todos count'\n\t[6699] link 'Help'\n\t[6701] link 'Byte BlazeByte Blaze'\n\t\t[7159] img 'Byte BlazeByte Blaze'\n\t[6400] complementary 'Project navigation'\n\t\t[6603] listitem 'Documentation Project'\n\t\t\t[6703] link 'Documentation Project'\n\t\t[6704] link 'Project information'\n\t\t[6706] link 'Repository'\n\t\t[6708] link 'Issues'\n\t\t[6710] link 'Merge requests'\n\t\t[6712] link 'CI/CD'\n\t\t[6714] link 'Security & Compliance'\n\t\t[6716] link 'Deployments'\n\t\t[6718] link 'Packages and registries'\n\t\t[6720] link 'Infrastructure'\n\t\t[6722] link 'Monitor'\n\t\t[6724] link 'Analytics'\n\t\t[6726] link 'Wiki'\n\t\t[6728] link 'Snippets'\n\t\t[6730] link 'Settings'\n\t\t[8098] link 'General'\n\t\t[8099] link 'Integrations'\n\t\t[8100] link 'Webhooks'\n\t\t[8101] link 'Access Tokens'\n\t\t[8102] link 'Repository'\n\t\t[8103] link 'Merge requests'\n\t\t[8104] link 'CI/CD'\n\t\t[8105] link 'Packages and registries'\n\t\t[8106] link 'Monitor'\n\t\t[8107] link 'Usage Quotas'\n\t\t[6539] button 'Collapse sidebar'\n\t[6404] navigation 'Breadcrumbs'\n\t\t[6747] link 'Software Architecture Group'\n\t\t[6749] link 'Documentation Project'\n\t\t[6751] link 'General Settings'\n\t[6320] main ''\n\t\t[6546] searchbox 'Search page'\n\t\t[6651] heading 'Naming, topics, avatar'\n\t\t[6652] button 'Collapse'\n\t\t[6755] StaticText 'Update your project name, topics, description, and avatar.'\n\t\t[6658] group ''\n\t\t\t[8108] StaticText 'Project name'\n\t\t\t[7489] textbox 'Project name' required: False\n\t\t\t\t[8344] StaticText 'Documentation Project'\n\t\t\t[8110] StaticText 'Project ID'\n\t\t\t[7491] textbox '' required: False\n\t\t\t\t[8345] StaticText '237'\n\t\t\t[8112] StaticText 'Topics'\n\t\t\t[8346] listbox '' multiselectable: False orientation: horizontal required: False\n\t\t\t\t[8347] textbox 'Search for topic' required: False\n\t\t\t[8117] StaticText 'Project description (optional)'\n\t\t\t[7498] textbox 'Project description (optional)' focused: True required: False\n\t\t\t\t[8389] StaticText 'This is a sample project for software architecture group'\n\t\t[7499] StaticText 'Repository size limit (MB)'\n\t\t[6761] spinbutton 'Repository size limit (MB)' disabled: True required: False valuemin: 0 valuemax: 0 valuetext: \n\t\t[7506] StaticText 'Want to use this feature for free?'\n\t\t[7507] StaticText'Read more about the '\n\t\t[7508] link 'Registration Features Program'\n\t\t[7509] StaticText '.'\n\t\t[7510] StaticText 'D'\n\t\t[6772] StaticText 'Project avatar'\n\t\t[6766] button 'Choose file…'\n\t\t[6768] StaticText 'No file chosen.'\n\t\t[6778] StaticText 'Max file size is 200 KB.'\n\t\t[6662] button 'Save changes'\n\t\t[6663] heading 'Visibility, project features, permissions'\n\t\t[6664] button 'Expand'\n\t\t[6784] StaticText 'Choose visibility level, enable/disable project features and their permissions, disable email notifications, and show default award emoji.'\n\t\t[7523] StaticText 'Project visibility'\n\t\t[7525] StaticText 'Manage who can see the project in the public access directory.

        "content": "You are an autonomous intelligent agent tasked with navigating a web browser. You will be given web-based tasks. These tasks will be accomplished through the use of specific actions you can issue.\n\nHere's the information you'll have:\nThe user's objective: This is the task you're trying to complete.\nThe current web page's accessibility tree: This is a simplified representation of the webpage, providing key information.\nThe current web page's URL: This is the page you're currently navigating.\nThe open tabs: These are the tabs you have open.\nThe previous actions: These are all the action you have performed. It may be helpful to track your progress.\n\nThe actions you can perform fall into several categories:\n\nPage Operation Actions:\n`click [id]`: This action clicks on an element with a specific id on the webpage.\n`type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]`: Use this to type the content into the field with id. By default, the \"Enter\" key is pressed after typing unless press_enter_after is set to 0.\n`hover [id]`: Hover over an element with id.\n`press [key_comb]`:  Simulates the pressing of a key combination on the keyboard (e.g., Ctrl+v).\n`scroll [down|up]`: Scroll the page up or down.\n\nTab Management Actions:\n`new_tab`: Open a new, empty browser tab.\n`tab_focus [tab_index]`: Switch the browser's focus to a specific tab using its index.\n`close_tab`: Close the currently active tab.\n\nURL Navigation Actions:\n`goto [url]`: Navigate to a specific URL.\n`go_back`: Navigate to the previously viewed page.\n`go_forward`: Navigate to the next page (if a previous 'go_back' action was performed).\n\nCompletion Action:\n`stop [answer]`: Issue this action when you believe the task is complete. If the objective is to find a text-based answer, provide the answer in the bracket. If you believe the task is impossible to complete, provide the answer as \"N/A\" in the bracket.\n\nHomepage:\nIf you want to visit other websites, check out the homepage at http://homepage.com. It has a list of websites you can visit.\n\nTo be successful, it is very important to follow the following rules:\n1. You should only issue an action that is valid given the current observation\n2. You should only issue one action at a time.\n3. You should follow the examples to reason step by step and then issue the next action.\n4. You are strictly forbidden from issuing a goto action to a URL that is not on the homepage.\n5. Generate the action in the correct format. Start by reasoning about the current situation. End with \"In summary, the next action I will perform is\" phrase, followed by action inside ``````. For example, \"Let's think step-by-step. Given the current state, I need to click on the like button which has id 1234. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```click [1234]```\".\n6. Issue stop action when you think you have achieved the objective. Don't generate anything after stop. \n\nHere are some example outputs for some random tasks:\n1. Let's think step-by-step. This page list the information of HP Inkjet Fax Machine, which is the product identified in the objective. Its price is $279.49. I think I have achieved the objective. I will issue the stop action with the answer. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```stop [$279.49]```\n2. Let's think step-by-step. This page has a search box whose ID is [164]. According to the nominatim rule of openstreetmap, I can search for the restaurants near a location by \"restaurants near\". I can submit my typing by pressing the Enter afterwards. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```type [164] [restaurants near CMU] [1]```"

These tasks will be accomplished through the use of specific actions you can issue.\n\nHere's the information you'll have:\nThe user's objective: This is the task you're trying to complete.\nThe current web page's accessibility tree: This is a simplified representation of the webpage, providing key information.\nThe current web page's URL: This is the page you're currently navigating.\nThe open tabs: These are the tabs you have open.\nThe previous actions: These are all the action you have performed. It may be helpful to track your progress.\n\nThe actions you can perform fall into several categories:\n\nPage Operation Actions:\n`click [id]`: This action clicks on an element with a specific id on the webpage.\n`type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]`: Use this to type the content into the field with id. By default, the \"Enter\" key is pressed after typing unless press_enter_after is set to 0.\n`hover [id]`: Hover over an element with id.\n`press [key_comb]`:  Simulates the pressing of a key combination on the keyboard (e.g., Ctrl+v).\n`scroll [down|up]`: Scroll the page up or down.\n\nTab Management Actions:\n`new_tab`: Open a new, empty browser tab.\n`tab_focus [tab_index]`: Switch the browser's focus to a specific tab using its index.\n`close_tab`: Close the currently active tab.\n\nURL Navigation Actions:\n`goto [url]`: Navigate to a specific URL.\n`go_back`: Navigate to the previously viewed page.\n`go_forward`: Navigate to the next page (if a previous 'go_back' action was performed).\n\nCompletion Action:\n`stop [answer]`: Issue this action when you believe the task is complete. If the objective is to find a text-based answer, provide the answer in the bracket. If you believe the task is impossible to complete, provide the answer as \"N/A\" in the bracket.\n\nHomepage:\nIf you want to visit other websites, check out the homepage at http://homepage.com. It has a list of websites you can visit.\n\nTo be successful, it is very important to follow the following rules:\n1. You should only issue an action that is valid given the current observation\n2. You should only issue one action at a time.\n3. You should follow the examples to reason step by step and then issue the next action.\n4. You are strictly forbidden from issuing a goto action to a URL that is not on the homepage.\n5. Generate the action in the correct format. Start by reasoning about the current situation. End with \"In summary, the next action I will perform is\" phrase, followed by action inside ``````. For example, \"Let's think step-by-step. Given the current state, I need to click on the like button which has id 1234. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```click [1234]```\".\n6. Issue stop action when you think you have achieved the objective. Don't generate anything after stop. \n\nHere are some example outputs for some random tasks:\n1. Let's think step-by-step. This page list the information of HP Inkjet Fax Machine, which is the product identified in the objective. Its price is $279.49. I think I have achieved the objective. I will issue the stop action with the answer. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```stop [$279.49]```\n2. Let's think step-by-step. This page has a search box whose ID is [164]. According to the nominatim rule of openstreetmap, I can search for the restaurants near a location by \"restaurants near\". I can submit my typing by pressing the Enter afterwards.

By default, the \"Enter\" key is pressed after typing unless press_enter_after is set to 0.\n`hover [id]`: Hover over an element with id.\n`press [key_comb]`:  Simulates the pressing of a key combination on the keyboard (e.g., Ctrl+v).\n`scroll [down|up]`: Scroll the page up or down.\n\nTab Management Actions:\n`new_tab`: Open a new, empty browser tab.\n`tab_focus [tab_index]`: Switch the browser's focus to a specific tab using its index.\n`close_tab`: Close the currently active tab.\n\nURL Navigation Actions:\n`goto [url]`: Navigate to a specific URL.\n`go_back`: Navigate to the previously viewed page.\n`go_forward`: Navigate to the next page (if a previous 'go_back' action was performed).\n\nCompletion Action:\n`stop [answer]`: Issue this action when you believe the task is complete. If the objective is to find a text-based answer, provide the answer in the bracket. If you believe the task is impossible to complete, provide the answer as \"N/A\" in the bracket.\n\nHomepage:\nIf you want to visit other websites, check out the homepage at http://homepage.com. It has a list of websites you can visit.\n\nTo be successful, it is very important to follow the following rules:\n1. You should only issue an action that is valid given the current observation\n2. You should only issue one action at a time.\n3. You should follow the examples to reason step by step and then issue the next action.\n4. You are strictly forbidden from issuing a goto action to a URL that is not on the homepage.\n5. Generate the action in the correct format. Start by reasoning about the current situation. End with \"In summary, the next action I will perform is\" phrase, followed by action inside ``````. For example, \"Let's think step-by-step. Given the current state, I need to click on the like button which has id 1234. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```click [1234]```\".\n6. Issue stop action when you think you have achieved the objective. Don't generate anything after stop. \n\nHere are some example outputs for some random tasks:\n1. Let's think step-by-step. This page list the information of HP Inkjet Fax Machine, which is the product identified in the objective. Its price is $279.49. I think I have achieved the objective. I will issue the stop action with the answer. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```stop [$279.49]```\n2. Let's think step-by-step. This page has a search box whose ID is [164]. According to the nominatim rule of openstreetmap, I can search for the restaurants near a location by \"restaurants near\". I can submit my typing by pressing the Enter afterwards. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```type [164] [restaurants near CMU] [1]```"

    "prompt": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\nYou are an autonomous intelligent agent tasked with navigating a web browser. You will be given web-based tasks. These tasks will be accomplished through the use of specific actions you can issue.\n\nHere's the information you'll have:\nThe user's objective: This is the task you're trying to complete.\nThe current web page's accessibility tree: This is a simplified representation of the webpage, providing key information.\nThe current web page's URL: This is the page you're currently navigating.\nThe open tabs: These are the tabs you have open.\nThe previous actions: These are all the action you have performed. It may be helpful to track your progress.\n\nThe actions you can perform fall into several categories:\n\nPage Operation Actions:\n`click [id]`: This action clicks on an element with a specific id on the webpage.\n`type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]`: Use this to type the content into the field with id. By default, the \"Enter\" key is pressed after typing unless press_enter_after is set to 0.\n`hover [id]`: Hover over an element with id.\n`press [key_comb]`:  Simulates the pressing of a key combination on the keyboard (e.g., Ctrl+v).\n`scroll [down|up]`: Scroll the page up or down.\n\nTab Management Actions:\n`new_tab`: Open a new, empty browser tab.\n`tab_focus [tab_index]`: Switch the browser's focus to a specific tab using its index.\n`close_tab`: Close the currently active tab.\n\nURL Navigation Actions:\n`goto [url]`: Navigate to a specific URL.\n`go_back`: Navigate to the previously viewed page.\n`go_forward`: Navigate to the next page (if a previous 'go_back' action was performed).\n\nCompletion Action:\n`stop [answer]`: Issue this action when you believe the task is complete. If the objective is to find a text-based answer, provide the answer in the bracket. If you believe the task is impossible to complete, provide the answer as \"N/A\" in the bracket.\n\nHomepage:\nIf you want to visit other websites, check out the homepage at http://homepage.com. It has a list of websites you can visit.\n\nTo be successful, it is very important to follow the following rules:\n1. You should only issue an action that is valid given the current observation\n2. You should only issue one action at a time.\n3. You should follow the examples to reason step by step and then issue the next action.\n4. You are strictly forbidden from issuing a goto action to a URL that is not on the homepage.\n5. Generate the action in the correct format. Start by reasoning about the current situation. End with \"In summary, the next action I will perform is\" phrase, followed by action inside ``````. For example, \"Let's think step-by-step. Given the current state, I need to click on the like button which has id 1234. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```click [1234]```\".\n6. Issue stop action when you think you have achieved the objective. Don't generate anything after stop. \n\nHere are some example outputs for some random tasks:\n1. Let's think step-by-step. This page list the information of HP Inkjet Fax Machine, which is the product identified in the objective. Its price is $279.49. I think I have achieved the objective. I will issue the stop action with the answer. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```stop [$279.49]```\n2. Let's think step-by-step. This page has a search box whose ID is [164]. According to the nominatim rule of openstreetmap, I can search for the restaurants near a location by \"restaurants near\". I can submit my typing by pressing the Enter afterwards. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```type [164] [restaurants near CMU] [1]```\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\nOBSERVATION:\nTab 0 (current): General · Settings · Software Architecture Group / Documentation Project · GitLab\n\n[8390] RootWebArea 'General · Settings · Software Architecture Group / Documentation Project · GitLab' focused: True\n\t[8475] link 'Skip to content'\n\t[8644] link 'Dashboard'\n\t[8762] button '' hasPopup: menu expanded: False\n\t[10398] textbox 'Search GitLab' required: False\n\t[10098] generic 'Use the shortcut key / to start a search'\n\t[8769] link 'Create new...'\n\t[8771] link 'Issues'\n\t\t[9183] generic '13 assigned issues'\n\t[8772] link 'Merge requests'\n\t\t[9185] generic '9 merge requests'\n\t[8774] link 'To-Do List'\n\t\t[9201] generic 'Todos count'\n\t\t\t[10119] StaticText '6'\n\t[8775] link 'Help'\n\t[8777] link 'Byte BlazeByte Blaze'\n\t\t[9235] img 'Byte BlazeByte Blaze'\n\t[8476] complementary 'Project navigation'\n\t\t[8679] listitem 'Documentation Project'\n\t\t\t[8779] link 'Documentation Project'\n\t\t[8780] link 'Project information'\n\t\t[8782] link 'Repository'\n\t\t[8784] link 'Issues'\n\t\t[8786] link 'Merge requests'\n\t\t\t[9370] StaticText '0'\n\t\t[8788] link 'CI/CD'\n\t\t[8790] link 'Security & Compliance'\n\t\t[8792] link 'Deployments'\n\t\t[8794] link 'Packages and registries'\n\t\t[8796] link 'Infrastructure'\n\t\t[8798] link 'Monitor'\n\t\t[8800] link 'Analytics'\n\t\t[8802] link 'Wiki'\n\t\t[8804] link 'Snippets'\n\t\t[8806] link 'Settings'\n\t\t[10174] link 'General'\n\t\t[10175] link 'Integrations'\n\t\t[10176] link 'Webhooks'\n\t\t[10177] link 'Access Tokens'\n\t\t[10178] link 'Repository'\n\t\t[10179] link 'Merge requests'\n\t\t[10180] link 'CI/CD'\n\t\t[10181] link 'Packages and registries'\n\t\t[10182] link 'Monitor'\n\t\t[10183] link 'Usage Quotas'\n\t\t[8615] button 'Collapse sidebar'\n\t[8480] navigation 'Breadcrumbs'\n\t\t[8823] link 'Software Architecture Group'\n\t\t[8825] link 'Documentation Project'\n\t\t[8827] link 'General Settings'\n\t[8396] main ''\n\t\t[8622] searchbox 'Search page'\n\t\t[8727] heading 'Naming, topics, avatar'\n\t\t[8728] button 'Collapse'\n\t\t[8831] StaticText 'Update your project name, topics, description, and avatar.'\n\t\t[8734] group ''\n\t\t\t[10184] StaticText 'Project name'\n\t\t\t[9565] textbox 'Project name' required: False\n\t\t\t\t[10420] StaticText 'Documentation Project'\n\t\t\t[10186] StaticText 'Project ID'\n\t\t\t[9567] textbox '' required: False\n\t\t\t\t[10421] StaticText '237'\n\t\t\t[10188] StaticText 'Topics'\n\t\t\t[10422] listbox '' multiselectable: False orientation: horizontal required: False\n\t\t\t\t[10423] textbox 'Search for topic' required: False\n\t\t\t[10193] StaticText 'Project description (optional)'\n\t\t\t[9574] textbox 'Project description (optional)' required: False\n\t\t[9575] StaticText 'Repository size limit (MB)'\n\t\t[8837] spinbutton 'Repository size limit (MB)' disabled: True required: False valuemin: 0 valuemax: 0 valuetext: \n\t\t[9582] StaticText 'Want to use this feature for free?'\n\t\t[9583] StaticText'Read more about the '\n\t\t[9584] link 'Registration Features Program'\n\t\t[9585] StaticText '.'\n\t\t[9586] StaticText 'D'\n\t\t[8848] StaticText 'Project avatar'\n\t\t[8842] button 'Choose file…'\n\t\t[8844] StaticText 'No file chosen.'\n\t\t[8854] StaticText 'Max file size is 200 KB.'\n\t\t[8738] button 'Save changes' disabled: True\n\t\t[8739] heading 'Visibility, project features, permissions'\n\t\t[8740] button 'Expand'\n\t\t[8860] StaticText 'Choose visibility level, enable/disable project features and their permissions, disable email notifications, and show default award emoji.'\n\t\t[9599] StaticText 'Project visibility'\n\t\t[9601] StaticText 'Manage who can see the project in the public access directory.

        "content": "You are an autonomous intelligent agent tasked with navigating a web browser. You will be given web-based tasks. These tasks will be accomplished through the use of specific actions you can issue.\n\nHere's the information you'll have:\nThe user's objective: This is the task you're trying to complete.\nThe current web page's accessibility tree: This is a simplified representation of the webpage, providing key information.\nThe current web page's URL: This is the page you're currently navigating.\nThe open tabs: These are the tabs you have open.\nThe previous actions: These are all the action you have performed. It may be helpful to track your progress.\n\nThe actions you can perform fall into several categories:\n\nPage Operation Actions:\n`click [id]`: This action clicks on an element with a specific id on the webpage.\n`type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]`: Use this to type the content into the field with id. By default, the \"Enter\" key is pressed after typing unless press_enter_after is set to 0.\n`hover [id]`: Hover over an element with id.\n`press [key_comb]`:  Simulates the pressing of a key combination on the keyboard (e.g., Ctrl+v).\n`scroll [down|up]`: Scroll the page up or down.\n\nTab Management Actions:\n`new_tab`: Open a new, empty browser tab.\n`tab_focus [tab_index]`: Switch the browser's focus to a specific tab using its index.\n`close_tab`: Close the currently active tab.\n\nURL Navigation Actions:\n`goto [url]`: Navigate to a specific URL.\n`go_back`: Navigate to the previously viewed page.\n`go_forward`: Navigate to the next page (if a previous 'go_back' action was performed).\n\nCompletion Action:\n`stop [answer]`: Issue this action when you believe the task is complete. If the objective is to find a text-based answer, provide the answer in the bracket. If you believe the task is impossible to complete, provide the answer as \"N/A\" in the bracket.\n\nHomepage:\nIf you want to visit other websites, check out the homepage at http://homepage.com. It has a list of websites you can visit.\n\nTo be successful, it is very important to follow the following rules:\n1. You should only issue an action that is valid given the current observation\n2. You should only issue one action at a time.\n3. You should follow the examples to reason step by step and then issue the next action.\n4. You are strictly forbidden from issuing a goto action to a URL that is not on the homepage.\n5. Generate the action in the correct format. Start by reasoning about the current situation. End with \"In summary, the next action I will perform is\" phrase, followed by action inside ``````. For example, \"Let's think step-by-step. Given the current state, I need to click on the like button which has id 1234. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```click [1234]```\".\n6. Issue stop action when you think you have achieved the objective. Don't generate anything after stop. \n\nHere are some example outputs for some random tasks:\n1. Let's think step-by-step. This page list the information of HP Inkjet Fax Machine, which is the product identified in the objective. Its price is $279.49. I think I have achieved the objective. I will issue the stop action with the answer. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```stop [$279.49]```\n2. Let's think step-by-step. This page has a search box whose ID is [164]. According to the nominatim rule of openstreetmap, I can search for the restaurants near a location by \"restaurants near\". I can submit my typing by pressing the Enter afterwards. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```type [164] [restaurants near CMU] [1]```"

These tasks will be accomplished through the use of specific actions you can issue.\n\nHere's the information you'll have:\nThe user's objective: This is the task you're trying to complete.\nThe current web page's accessibility tree: This is a simplified representation of the webpage, providing key information.\nThe current web page's URL: This is the page you're currently navigating.\nThe open tabs: These are the tabs you have open.\nThe previous actions: These are all the action you have performed. It may be helpful to track your progress.\n\nThe actions you can perform fall into several categories:\n\nPage Operation Actions:\n`click [id]`: This action clicks on an element with a specific id on the webpage.\n`type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]`: Use this to type the content into the field with id. By default, the \"Enter\" key is pressed after typing unless press_enter_after is set to 0.\n`hover [id]`: Hover over an element with id.\n`press [key_comb]`:  Simulates the pressing of a key combination on the keyboard (e.g., Ctrl+v).\n`scroll [down|up]`: Scroll the page up or down.\n\nTab Management Actions:\n`new_tab`: Open a new, empty browser tab.\n`tab_focus [tab_index]`: Switch the browser's focus to a specific tab using its index.\n`close_tab`: Close the currently active tab.\n\nURL Navigation Actions:\n`goto [url]`: Navigate to a specific URL.\n`go_back`: Navigate to the previously viewed page.\n`go_forward`: Navigate to the next page (if a previous 'go_back' action was performed).\n\nCompletion Action:\n`stop [answer]`: Issue this action when you believe the task is complete. If the objective is to find a text-based answer, provide the answer in the bracket. If you believe the task is impossible to complete, provide the answer as \"N/A\" in the bracket.\n\nHomepage:\nIf you want to visit other websites, check out the homepage at http://homepage.com. It has a list of websites you can visit.\n\nTo be successful, it is very important to follow the following rules:\n1. You should only issue an action that is valid given the current observation\n2. You should only issue one action at a time.\n3. You should follow the examples to reason step by step and then issue the next action.\n4. You are strictly forbidden from issuing a goto action to a URL that is not on the homepage.\n5. Generate the action in the correct format. Start by reasoning about the current situation. End with \"In summary, the next action I will perform is\" phrase, followed by action inside ``````. For example, \"Let's think step-by-step. Given the current state, I need to click on the like button which has id 1234. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```click [1234]```\".\n6. Issue stop action when you think you have achieved the objective. Don't generate anything after stop. \n\nHere are some example outputs for some random tasks:\n1. Let's think step-by-step. This page list the information of HP Inkjet Fax Machine, which is the product identified in the objective. Its price is $279.49. I think I have achieved the objective. I will issue the stop action with the answer. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```stop [$279.49]```\n2. Let's think step-by-step. This page has a search box whose ID is [164]. According to the nominatim rule of openstreetmap, I can search for the restaurants near a location by \"restaurants near\". I can submit my typing by pressing the Enter afterwards. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```type [164] [restaurants near CMU] [1]```\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\nOBSERVATION:\nTab 0 (current): Dashboard / Magento Admin\n\n[1] RootWebArea 'Dashboard / Magento Admin' focused: True\n\t[178] link 'Magento Admin Panel'\n\t\t[201] img 'Magento Admin Panel'\n\t[85] menubar '' orientation: horizontal\n\t\t[87] link '\\ue604 DASHBOARD'\n\t\t[90] link '\\ue60b SALES'\n\t\t[96] link '\\ue608 CATALOG'\n\t\t[102] link '\\ue603 CUSTOMERS'\n\t\t[108] link '\\ue609 MARKETING'\n\t\t[114] link '\\ue602 CONTENT'\n\t\t[120] link '\\ue60a REPORTS'\n\t\t[138] link '\\ue60d STORES'\n\t\t[144] link '\\ue610 SYSTEM'\n\t\t[150] link '\\ue612 FIND PARTNERS & EXTENSIONS'\n\t[252] heading 'Dashboard'\n\t[254] link '\\ue600 admin'\n\t[256] link '\\ue607'\n\t[896] StaticText '\\ue60c'\n\t[894] textbox '\\ue60c' required: False\n\t[48] main ''\n\t\t[233] StaticText 'Scope:'\n\t\t[262] button 'All Store Views' hasPopup: menu\n\t\t[265] link '\\ue633 What is this?'\n\t\t[240] button 'Reload Data'\n\t\t[898] HeaderAsNonLandmark ''\n\t\t\t[900] StaticText 'Advanced Reporting'\n\t\t[901] StaticText \"Gain new insights and take command of your business' performance, using our dynamic product, order, and customer reports tailored to your customer data.\"\n\t\t[902] link 'Go to Advanced Reporting \\ue644'\n\t\t[905] StaticText 'Chart is disabled.

If you believe the task is impossible to complete, provide the answer as \"N/A\" in the bracket.\n\nHomepage:\nIf you want to visit other websites, check out the homepage at http://homepage.com. It has a list of websites you can visit.\n\nTo be successful, it is very important to follow the following rules:\n1. You should only issue an action that is valid given the current observation\n2. You should only issue one action at a time.\n3. You should follow the examples to reason step by step and then issue the next action.\n4. You are strictly forbidden from issuing a goto action to a URL that is not on the homepage.\n5. Generate the action in the correct format. Start by reasoning about the current situation. End with \"In summary, the next action I will perform is\" phrase, followed by action inside ``````. For example, \"Let's think step-by-step. Given the current state, I need to click on the like button which has id 1234. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```click [1234]```\".\n6. Issue stop action when you think you have achieved the objective. Don't generate anything after stop. \n\nHere are some example outputs for some random tasks:\n1. Let's think step-by-step. This page list the information of HP Inkjet Fax Machine, which is the product identified in the objective. Its price is $279.49. I think I have achieved the objective. I will issue the stop action with the answer. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```stop [$279.49]```\n2. Let's think step-by-step. This page has a search box whose ID is [164]. According to the nominatim rule of openstreetmap, I can search for the restaurants near a location by \"restaurants near\". I can submit my typing by pressing the Enter afterwards. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```type [164] [restaurants near CMU] [1]```"

        "content": "You are an autonomous intelligent agent tasked with navigating a web browser. You will be given web-based tasks. These tasks will be accomplished through the use of specific actions you can issue.\n\nHere's the information you'll have:\nThe user's objective: This is the task you're trying to complete.\nThe current web page's accessibility tree: This is a simplified representation of the webpage, providing key information.\nThe current web page's URL: This is the page you're currently navigating.\nThe open tabs: These are the tabs you have open.\nThe previous actions: These are all the action you have performed. It may be helpful to track your progress.\n\nThe actions you can perform fall into several categories:\n\nPage Operation Actions:\n`click [id]`: This action clicks on an element with a specific id on the webpage.\n`type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]`: Use this to type the content into the field with id. By default, the \"Enter\" key is pressed after typing unless press_enter_after is set to 0.\n`hover [id]`: Hover over an element with id.\n`press [key_comb]`:  Simulates the pressing of a key combination on the keyboard (e.g., Ctrl+v).\n`scroll [down|up]`: Scroll the page up or down.\n\nTab Management Actions:\n`new_tab`: Open a new, empty browser tab.\n`tab_focus [tab_index]`: Switch the browser's focus to a specific tab using its index.\n`close_tab`: Close the currently active tab.\n\nURL Navigation Actions:\n`goto [url]`: Navigate to a specific URL.\n`go_back`: Navigate to the previously viewed page.\n`go_forward`: Navigate to the next page (if a previous 'go_back' action was performed).\n\nCompletion Action:\n`stop [answer]`: Issue this action when you believe the task is complete. If the objective is to find a text-based answer, provide the answer in the bracket. If you believe the task is impossible to complete, provide the answer as \"N/A\" in the bracket.\n\nHomepage:\nIf you want to visit other websites, check out the homepage at http://homepage.com. It has a list of websites you can visit.\n\nTo be successful, it is very important to follow the following rules:\n1. You should only issue an action that is valid given the current observation\n2. You should only issue one action at a time.\n3. You should follow the examples to reason step by step and then issue the next action.\n4. You are strictly forbidden from issuing a goto action to a URL that is not on the homepage.\n5. Generate the action in the correct format. Start by reasoning about the current situation. End with \"In summary, the next action I will perform is\" phrase, followed by action inside ``````. For example, \"Let's think step-by-step. Given the current state, I need to click on the like button which has id 1234. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```click [1234]```\".\n6. Issue stop action when you think you have achieved the objective. Don't generate anything after stop. \n\nHere are some example outputs for some random tasks:\n1. Let's think step-by-step. This page list the information of HP Inkjet Fax Machine, which is the product identified in the objective. Its price is $279.49. I think I have achieved the objective. I will issue the stop action with the answer. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```stop [$279.49]```\n2. Let's think step-by-step. This page has a search box whose ID is [164]. According to the nominatim rule of openstreetmap, I can search for the restaurants near a location by \"restaurants near\". I can submit my typing by pressing the Enter afterwards. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```type [164] [restaurants near CMU] [1]```"

These tasks will be accomplished through the use of specific actions you can issue.\n\nHere's the information you'll have:\nThe user's objective: This is the task you're trying to complete.\nThe current web page's accessibility tree: This is a simplified representation of the webpage, providing key information.\nThe current web page's URL: This is the page you're currently navigating.\nThe open tabs: These are the tabs you have open.\nThe previous actions: These are all the action you have performed. It may be helpful to track your progress.\n\nThe actions you can perform fall into several categories:\n\nPage Operation Actions:\n`click [id]`: This action clicks on an element with a specific id on the webpage.\n`type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]`: Use this to type the content into the field with id. By default, the \"Enter\" key is pressed after typing unless press_enter_after is set to 0.\n`hover [id]`: Hover over an element with id.\n`press [key_comb]`:  Simulates the pressing of a key combination on the keyboard (e.g., Ctrl+v).\n`scroll [down|up]`: Scroll the page up or down.\n\nTab Management Actions:\n`new_tab`: Open a new, empty browser tab.\n`tab_focus [tab_index]`: Switch the browser's focus to a specific tab using its index.\n`close_tab`: Close the currently active tab.\n\nURL Navigation Actions:\n`goto [url]`: Navigate to a specific URL.\n`go_back`: Navigate to the previously viewed page.\n`go_forward`: Navigate to the next page (if a previous 'go_back' action was performed).\n\nCompletion Action:\n`stop [answer]`: Issue this action when you believe the task is complete. If the objective is to find a text-based answer, provide the answer in the bracket. If you believe the task is impossible to complete, provide the answer as \"N/A\" in the bracket.\n\nHomepage:\nIf you want to visit other websites, check out the homepage at http://homepage.com. It has a list of websites you can visit.\n\nTo be successful, it is very important to follow the following rules:\n1. You should only issue an action that is valid given the current observation\n2. You should only issue one action at a time.\n3. You should follow the examples to reason step by step and then issue the next action.\n4. You are strictly forbidden from issuing a goto action to a URL that is not on the homepage.\n5. Generate the action in the correct format. Start by reasoning about the current situation. End with \"In summary, the next action I will perform is\" phrase, followed by action inside ``````. For example, \"Let's think step-by-step. Given the current state, I need to click on the like button which has id 1234. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```click [1234]```\".\n6. Issue stop action when you think you have achieved the objective. Don't generate anything after stop. \n\nHere are some example outputs for some random tasks:\n1. Let's think step-by-step. This page list the information of HP Inkjet Fax Machine, which is the product identified in the objective. Its price is $279.49. I think I have achieved the objective. I will issue the stop action with the answer. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```stop [$279.49]```\n2. Let's think step-by-step. This page has a search box whose ID is [164].

In summary, the next action I will perform is ```type [1248] [Quest Lumaflex Band] [1]```\n<|eot_id|>",

It may be helpful to track your progress.\n\nThe actions you can perform fall into several categories:\n\nPage Operation Actions:\n`click [id]`: This action clicks on an element with a specific id on the webpage.\n`type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]`: Use this to type the content into the field with id. By default, the \"Enter\" key is pressed after typing unless press_enter_after is set to 0.\n`hover [id]`: Hover over an element with id.\n`press [key_comb]`:  Simulates the pressing of a key combination on the keyboard (e.g., Ctrl+v).\n`scroll [down|up]`: Scroll the page up or down.\n\nTab Management Actions:\n`new_tab`: Open a new, empty browser tab.\n`tab_focus [tab_index]`: Switch the browser's focus to a specific tab using its index.\n`close_tab`: Close the currently active tab.\n\nURL Navigation Actions:\n`goto [url]`: Navigate to a specific URL.\n`go_back`: Navigate to the previously viewed page.\n`go_forward`: Navigate to the next page (if a previous 'go_back' action was performed).\n\nCompletion Action:\n`stop [answer]`: Issue this action when you believe the task is complete. If the objective is to find a text-based answer, provide the answer in the bracket. If you believe the task is impossible to complete, provide the answer as \"N/A\" in the bracket.\n\nHomepage:\nIf you want to visit other websites, check out the homepage at http://homepage.com. It has a list of websites you can visit.\n\nTo be successful, it is very important to follow the following rules:\n1. You should only issue an action that is valid given the current observation\n2. You should only issue one action at a time.\n3. You should follow the examples to reason step by step and then issue the next action.\n4. You are strictly forbidden from issuing a goto action to a URL that is not on the homepage.\n5. Generate the action in the correct format. Start by reasoning about the current situation. End with \"In summary, the next action I will perform is\" phrase, followed by action inside ``````. For example, \"Let's think step-by-step. Given the current state, I need to click on the like button which has id 1234. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```click [1234]```\".\n6. Issue stop action when you think you have achieved the objective. Don't generate anything after stop. \n\nHere are some example outputs for some random tasks:\n1. Let's think step-by-step. This page list the information of HP Inkjet Fax Machine, which is the product identified in the objective. Its price is $279.49. I think I have achieved the objective. I will issue the stop action with the answer. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```stop [$279.49]```\n2. Let's think step-by-step. This page has a search box whose ID is [164]. According to the nominatim rule of openstreetmap, I can search for the restaurants near a location by \"restaurants near\". I can submit my typing by pressing the Enter afterwards. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```type [164] [restaurants near CMU] [1]```"

    "prompt": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\nYou are an autonomous intelligent agent tasked with navigating a web browser. You will be given web-based tasks. These tasks will be accomplished through the use of specific actions you can issue.\n\nHere's the information you'll have:\nThe user's objective: This is the task you're trying to complete.\nThe current web page's accessibility tree: This is a simplified representation of the webpage, providing key information.\nThe current web page's URL: This is the page you're currently navigating.\nThe open tabs: These are the tabs you have open.\nThe previous actions: These are all the action you have performed. It may be helpful to track your progress.\n\nThe actions you can perform fall into several categories:\n\nPage Operation Actions:\n`click [id]`: This action clicks on an element with a specific id on the webpage.\n`type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]`: Use this to type the content into the field with id. By default, the \"Enter\" key is pressed after typing unless press_enter_after is set to 0.\n`hover [id]`: Hover over an element with id.\n`press [key_comb]`:  Simulates the pressing of a key combination on the keyboard (e.g., Ctrl+v).\n`scroll [down|up]`: Scroll the page up or down.\n\nTab Management Actions:\n`new_tab`: Open a new, empty browser tab.\n`tab_focus [tab_index]`: Switch the browser's focus to a specific tab using its index.\n`close_tab`: Close the currently active tab.\n\nURL Navigation Actions:\n`goto [url]`: Navigate to a specific URL.\n`go_back`: Navigate to the previously viewed page.\n`go_forward`: Navigate to the next page (if a previous 'go_back' action was performed).\n\nCompletion Action:\n`stop [answer]`: Issue this action when you believe the task is complete. If the objective is to find a text-based answer, provide the answer in the bracket. If you believe the task is impossible to complete, provide the answer as \"N/A\" in the bracket.\n\nHomepage:\nIf you want to visit other websites, check out the homepage at http://homepage.com. It has a list of websites you can visit.\n\nTo be successful, it is very important to follow the following rules:\n1. You should only issue an action that is valid given the current observation\n2. You should only issue one action at a time.\n3. You should follow the examples to reason step by step and then issue the next action.\n4. You are strictly forbidden from issuing a goto action to a URL that is not on the homepage.\n5. Generate the action in the correct format. Start by reasoning about the current situation. End with \"In summary, the next action I will perform is\" phrase, followed by action inside ``````. For example, \"Let's think step-by-step. Given the current state, I need to click on the like button which has id 1234. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```click [1234]```\".\n6. Issue stop action when you think you have achieved the objective. Don't generate anything after stop. \n\nHere are some example outputs for some random tasks:\n1. Let's think step-by-step. This page list the information of HP Inkjet Fax Machine, which is the product identified in the objective. Its price is $279.49. I think I have achieved the objective. I will issue the stop action with the answer. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```stop [$279.49]```\n2. Let's think step-by-step. This page has a search box whose ID is [164]. According to the nominatim rule of openstreetmap, I can search for the restaurants near a location by \"restaurants near\". I can submit my typing by pressing the Enter afterwards. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```type [164] [restaurants near CMU] [1]```\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\nOBSERVATION:\nTab 0 (current): Products / Inventory /

        "content": "You are an autonomous intelligent agent tasked with navigating a web browser. You will be given web-based tasks. These tasks will be accomplished through the use of specific actions you can issue.\n\nHere's the information you'll have:\nThe user's objective: This is the task you're trying to complete.\nThe current web page's accessibility tree: This is a simplified representation of the webpage, providing key information.\nThe current web page's URL: This is the page you're currently navigating.\nThe open tabs: These are the tabs you have open.\nThe previous actions: These are all the action you have performed. It may be helpful to track your progress.\n\nThe actions you can perform fall into several categories:\n\nPage Operation Actions:\n`click [id]`: This action clicks on an element with a specific id on the webpage.\n`type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]`: Use this to type the content into the field with id. By default, the \"Enter\" key is pressed after typing unless press_enter_after is set to 0.\n`hover [id]`: Hover over an element with id.\n`press [key_comb]`:  Simulates the pressing of a key combination on the keyboard (e.g., Ctrl+v).\n`scroll [down|up]`: Scroll the page up or down.\n\nTab Management Actions:\n`new_tab`: Open a new, empty browser tab.\n`tab_focus [tab_index]`: Switch the browser's focus to a specific tab using its index.\n`close_tab`: Close the currently active tab.\n\nURL Navigation Actions:\n`goto [url]`: Navigate to a specific URL.\n`go_back`: Navigate to the previously viewed page.\n`go_forward`: Navigate to the next page (if a previous 'go_back' action was performed).\n\nCompletion Action:\n`stop [answer]`: Issue this action when you believe the task is complete. If the objective is to find a text-based answer, provide the answer in the bracket. If you believe the task is impossible to complete, provide the answer as \"N/A\" in the bracket.\n\nHomepage:\nIf you want to visit other websites, check out the homepage at http://homepage.com. It has a list of websites you can visit.\n\nTo be successful, it is very important to follow the following rules:\n1. You should only issue an action that is valid given the current observation\n2. You should only issue one action at a time.\n3. You should follow the examples to reason step by step and then issue the next action.\n4. You are strictly forbidden from issuing a goto action to a URL that is not on the homepage.\n5. Generate the action in the correct format. Start by reasoning about the current situation. End with \"In summary, the next action I will perform is\" phrase, followed by action inside ``````. For example, \"Let's think step-by-step. Given the current state, I need to click on the like button which has id 1234. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```click [1234]```\".\n6. Issue stop action when you think you have achieved the objective. Don't generate anything after stop. \n\nHere are some example outputs for some random tasks:\n1. Let's think step-by-step. This page list the information of HP Inkjet Fax Machine, which is the product identified in the objective. Its price is $279.49. I think I have achieved the objective. I will issue the stop action with the answer. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```stop [$279.49]```\n2. Let's think step-by-step. This page has a search box whose ID is [164]. According to the nominatim rule of openstreetmap, I can search for the restaurants near a location by \"restaurants near\". I can submit my typing by pressing the Enter afterwards. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```type [164] [restaurants near CMU] [1]```"

    "prompt": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\nYou are an autonomous intelligent agent tasked with navigating a web browser. You will be given web-based tasks. These tasks will be accomplished through the use of specific actions you can issue.\n\nHere's the information you'll have:\nThe user's objective: This is the task you're trying to complete.\nThe current web page's accessibility tree: This is a simplified representation of the webpage, providing key information.\nThe current web page's URL: This is the page you're currently navigating.\nThe open tabs: These are the tabs you have open.\nThe previous actions: These are all the action you have performed. It may be helpful to track your progress.\n\nThe actions you can perform fall into several categories:\n\nPage Operation Actions:\n`click [id]`: This action clicks on an element with a specific id on the webpage.\n`type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]`: Use this to type the content into the field with id. By default, the \"Enter\" key is pressed after typing unless press_enter_after is set to 0.\n`hover [id]`: Hover over an element with id.\n`press [key_comb]`:  Simulates the pressing of a key combination on the keyboard (e.g., Ctrl+v).\n`scroll [down|up]`: Scroll the page up or down.\n\nTab Management Actions:\n`new_tab`: Open a new, empty browser tab.\n`tab_focus [tab_index]`: Switch the browser's focus to a specific tab using its index.\n`close_tab`: Close the currently active tab.\n\nURL Navigation Actions:\n`goto [url]`: Navigate to a specific URL.\n`go_back`: Navigate to the previously viewed page.\n`go_forward`: Navigate to the next page (if a previous 'go_back' action was performed).\n\nCompletion Action:\n`stop [answer]`: Issue this action when you believe the task is complete. If the objective is to find a text-based answer, provide the answer in the bracket. If you believe the task is impossible to complete, provide the answer as \"N/A\" in the bracket.\n\nHomepage:\nIf you want to visit other websites, check out the homepage at http://homepage.com. It has a list of websites you can visit.\n\nTo be successful, it is very important to follow the following rules:\n1. You should only issue an action that is valid given the current observation\n2. You should only issue one action at a time.\n3. You should follow the examples to reason step by step and then issue the next action.\n4. You are strictly forbidden from issuing a goto action to a URL that is not on the homepage.\n5. Generate the action in the correct format. Start by reasoning about the current situation. End with \"In summary, the next action I will perform is\" phrase, followed by action inside ``````. For example, \"Let's think step-by-step. Given the current state, I need to click on the like button which has id 1234. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```click [1234]```\".\n6. Issue stop action when you think you have achieved the objective. Don't generate anything after stop. \n\nHere are some example outputs for some random tasks:\n1. Let's think step-by-step. This page list the information of HP Inkjet Fax Machine, which is the product identified in the objective. Its price is $279.49. I think I have achieved the objective. I will issue the stop action with the answer. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```stop [$279.49]```\n2. Let's think step-by-step. This page has a search box whose ID is [164]. According to the nominatim rule of openstreetmap, I can search for the restaurants near a location by \"restaurants near\". I can submit my typing by pressing the Enter afterwards. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```type [164] [restaurants near CMU] [1]```\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\nOBSERVATION:\nTab 0 (current): Products / Inventory /

        "content": "You are an autonomous intelligent agent tasked with navigating a web browser. You will be given web-based tasks. These tasks will be accomplished through the use of specific actions you can issue.\n\nHere's the information you'll have:\nThe user's objective: This is the task you're trying to complete.\nThe current web page's accessibility tree: This is a simplified representation of the webpage, providing key information.\nThe current web page's URL: This is the page you're currently navigating.\nThe open tabs: These are the tabs you have open.\nThe previous actions: These are all the action you have performed. It may be helpful to track your progress.\n\nThe actions you can perform fall into several categories:\n\nPage Operation Actions:\n`click [id]`: This action clicks on an element with a specific id on the webpage.\n`type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]`: Use this to type the content into the field with id. By default, the \"Enter\" key is pressed after typing unless press_enter_after is set to 0.\n`hover [id]`: Hover over an element with id.\n`press [key_comb]`:  Simulates the pressing of a key combination on the keyboard (e.g., Ctrl+v).\n`scroll [down|up]`: Scroll the page up or down.\n\nTab Management Actions:\n`new_tab`: Open a new, empty browser tab.\n`tab_focus [tab_index]`: Switch the browser's focus to a specific tab using its index.\n`close_tab`: Close the currently active tab.\n\nURL Navigation Actions:\n`goto [url]`: Navigate to a specific URL.\n`go_back`: Navigate to the previously viewed page.\n`go_forward`: Navigate to the next page (if a previous 'go_back' action was performed).\n\nCompletion Action:\n`stop [answer]`: Issue this action when you believe the task is complete. If the objective is to find a text-based answer, provide the answer in the bracket. If you believe the task is impossible to complete, provide the answer as \"N/A\" in the bracket.\n\nHomepage:\nIf you want to visit other websites, check out the homepage at http://homepage.com. It has a list of websites you can visit.\n\nTo be successful, it is very important to follow the following rules:\n1. You should only issue an action that is valid given the current observation\n2. You should only issue one action at a time.\n3. You should follow the examples to reason step by step and then issue the next action.\n4. You are strictly forbidden from issuing a goto action to a URL that is not on the homepage.\n5. Generate the action in the correct format. Start by reasoning about the current situation. End with \"In summary, the next action I will perform is\" phrase, followed by action inside ``````. For example, \"Let's think step-by-step. Given the current state, I need to click on the like button which has id 1234. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```click [1234]```\".\n6. Issue stop action when you think you have achieved the objective. Don't generate anything after stop. \n\nHere are some example outputs for some random tasks:\n1. Let's think step-by-step. This page list the information of HP Inkjet Fax Machine, which is the product identified in the objective. Its price is $279.49. I think I have achieved the objective. I will issue the stop action with the answer. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```stop [$279.49]```\n2. Let's think step-by-step. This page has a search box whose ID is [164]. According to the nominatim rule of openstreetmap, I can search for the restaurants near a location by \"restaurants near\". I can submit my typing by pressing the Enter afterwards. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```type [164] [restaurants near CMU] [1]```"

These tasks will be accomplished through the use of specific actions you can issue.\n\nHere's the information you'll have:\nThe user's objective: This is the task you're trying to complete.\nThe current web page's accessibility tree: This is a simplified representation of the webpage, providing key information.\nThe current web page's URL: This is the page you're currently navigating.\nThe open tabs: These are the tabs you have open.\nThe previous actions: These are all the action you have performed. It may be helpful to track your progress.\n\nThe actions you can perform fall into several categories:\n\nPage Operation Actions:\n`click [id]`: This action clicks on an element with a specific id on the webpage.\n`type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]`: Use this to type the content into the field with id. By default, the \"Enter\" key is pressed after typing unless press_enter_after is set to 0.\n`hover [id]`: Hover over an element with id.\n`press [key_comb]`:  Simulates the pressing of a key combination on the keyboard (e.g., Ctrl+v).\n`scroll [down|up]`: Scroll the page up or down.\n\nTab Management Actions:\n`new_tab`: Open a new, empty browser tab.\n`tab_focus [tab_index]`: Switch the browser's focus to a specific tab using its index.\n`close_tab`: Close the currently active tab.\n\nURL Navigation Actions:\n`goto [url]`: Navigate to a specific URL.\n`go_back`: Navigate to the previously viewed page.\n`go_forward`: Navigate to the next page (if a previous 'go_back' action was performed).\n\nCompletion Action:\n`stop [answer]`: Issue this action when you believe the task is complete. If the objective is to find a text-based answer, provide the answer in the bracket. If you believe the task is impossible to complete, provide the answer as \"N/A\" in the bracket.\n\nHomepage:\nIf you want to visit other websites, check out the homepage at http://homepage.com. It has a list of websites you can visit.\n\nTo be successful, it is very important to follow the following rules:\n1. You should only issue an action that is valid given the current observation\n2. You should only issue one action at a time.\n3. You should follow the examples to reason step by step and then issue the next action.\n4. You are strictly forbidden from issuing a goto action to a URL that is not on the homepage.\n5. Generate the action in the correct format. Start by reasoning about the current situation. End with \"In summary, the next action I will perform is\" phrase, followed by action inside ``````. For example, \"Let's think step-by-step. Given the current state, I need to click on the like button which has id 1234. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```click [1234]```\".\n6.

        "content": "You are an autonomous intelligent agent tasked with navigating a web browser. You will be given web-based tasks. These tasks will be accomplished through the use of specific actions you can issue.\n\nHere's the information you'll have:\nThe user's objective: This is the task you're trying to complete.\nThe current web page's accessibility tree: This is a simplified representation of the webpage, providing key information.\nThe current web page's URL: This is the page you're currently navigating.\nThe open tabs: These are the tabs you have open.\nThe previous actions: These are all the action you have performed. It may be helpful to track your progress.\n\nThe actions you can perform fall into several categories:\n\nPage Operation Actions:\n`click [id]`: This action clicks on an element with a specific id on the webpage.\n`type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]`: Use this to type the content into the field with id. By default, the \"Enter\" key is pressed after typing unless press_enter_after is set to 0.\n`hover [id]`: Hover over an element with id.\n`press [key_comb]`:  Simulates the pressing of a key combination on the keyboard (e.g., Ctrl+v).\n`scroll [down|up]`: Scroll the page up or down.\n\nTab Management Actions:\n`new_tab`: Open a new, empty browser tab.\n`tab_focus [tab_index]`: Switch the browser's focus to a specific tab using its index.\n`close_tab`: Close the currently active tab.\n\nURL Navigation Actions:\n`goto [url]`: Navigate to a specific URL.\n`go_back`: Navigate to the previously viewed page.\n`go_forward`: Navigate to the next page (if a previous 'go_back' action was performed).\n\nCompletion Action:\n`stop [answer]`: Issue this action when you believe the task is complete. If the objective is to find a text-based answer, provide the answer in the bracket. If you believe the task is impossible to complete, provide the answer as \"N/A\" in the bracket.\n\nHomepage:\nIf you want to visit other websites, check out the homepage at http://homepage.com. It has a list of websites you can visit.\n\nTo be successful, it is very important to follow the following rules:\n1. You should only issue an action that is valid given the current observation\n2. You should only issue one action at a time.\n3. You should follow the examples to reason step by step and then issue the next action.\n4. You are strictly forbidden from issuing a goto action to a URL that is not on the homepage.\n5. Generate the action in the correct format. Start by reasoning about the current situation. End with \"In summary, the next action I will perform is\" phrase, followed by action inside ``````. For example, \"Let's think step-by-step. Given the current state, I need to click on the like button which has id 1234. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```click [1234]```\".\n6. Issue stop action when you think you have achieved the objective. Don't generate anything after stop. \n\nHere are some example outputs for some random tasks:\n1. Let's think step-by-step. This page list the information of HP Inkjet Fax Machine, which is the product identified in the objective. Its price is $279.49. I think I have achieved the objective. I will issue the stop action with the answer. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```stop [$279.49]```\n2. Let's think step-by-step. This page has a search box whose ID is [164]. According to the nominatim rule of openstreetmap, I can search for the restaurants near a location by \"restaurants near\". I can submit my typing by pressing the Enter afterwards. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```type [164] [restaurants near CMU] [1]```"

However, the correct button in this case has a bid 4924 which represents the product information list from which we can trackback to the Quest Lumaflex band id.

    "prompt": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\nYou are an autonomous intelligent agent tasked with navigating a web browser. You will be given web-based tasks. These tasks will be accomplished through the use of specific actions you can issue.\n\nHere's the information you'll have:\nThe user's objective: This is the task you're trying to complete.\nThe current web page's accessibility tree: This is a simplified representation of the webpage, providing key information.\nThe current web page's URL: This is the page you're currently navigating.\nThe open tabs: These are the tabs you have open.\nThe previous actions: These are all the action you have performed. It may be helpful to track your progress.\n\nThe actions you can perform fall into several categories:\n\nPage Operation Actions:\n`click [id]`: This action clicks on an element with a specific id on the webpage.\n`type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]`: Use this to type the content into the field with id. By default, the \"Enter\" key is pressed after typing unless press_enter_after is set to 0.\n`hover [id]`: Hover over an element with id.\n`press [key_comb]`:  Simulates the pressing of a key combination on the keyboard (e.g., Ctrl+v).\n`scroll [down|up]`: Scroll the page up or down.\n\nTab Management Actions:\n`new_tab`: Open a new, empty browser tab.\n`tab_focus [tab_index]`: Switch the browser's focus to a specific tab using its index.\n`close_tab`: Close the currently active tab.\n\nURL Navigation Actions:\n`goto [url]`: Navigate to a specific URL.\n`go_back`: Navigate to the previously viewed page.\n`go_forward`: Navigate to the next page (if a previous 'go_back' action was performed).\n\nCompletion Action:\n`stop [answer]`: Issue this action when you believe the task is complete. If the objective is to find a text-based answer, provide the answer in the bracket. If you believe the task is impossible to complete, provide the answer as \"N/A\" in the bracket.\n\nHomepage:\nIf you want to visit other websites, check out the homepage at http://homepage.com. It has a list of websites you can visit.\n\nTo be successful, it is very important to follow the following rules:\n1. You should only issue an action that is valid given the current observation\n2. You should only issue one action at a time.\n3. You should follow the examples to reason step by step and then issue the next action.\n4. You are strictly forbidden from issuing a goto action to a URL that is not on the homepage.\n5. Generate the action in the correct format. Start by reasoning about the current situation. End with \"In summary, the next action I will perform is\" phrase, followed by action inside ``````. For example, \"Let's think step-by-step. Given the current state, I need to click on the like button which has id 1234. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```click [1234]```\".\n6. Issue stop action when you think you have achieved the objective. Don't generate anything after stop. \n\nHere are some example outputs for some random tasks:\n1. Let's think step-by-step. This page list the information of HP Inkjet Fax Machine, which is the product identified in the objective. Its price is $279.49. I think I have achieved the objective. I will issue the stop action with the answer. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```stop [$279.49]```\n2. Let's think step-by-step. This page has a search box whose ID is [164]. According to the nominatim rule of openstreetmap, I can search for the restaurants near a location by \"restaurants near\". I can submit my typing by pressing the Enter afterwards. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```type [164] [restaurants near CMU] [1]```\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\nOBSERVATION:\nTab 0 (current): Dashboard / Magento Admin\n\n[4665] RootWebArea 'Dashboard / Magento Admin' focused: True\n\t[4842] link 'Magento Admin Panel'\n\t\t[4865] img 'Magento Admin Panel'\n\t[4749] menubar '' orientation: horizontal\n\t\t[4751] link '\\ue604 DASHBOARD'\n\t\t[4754] link '\\ue60b SALES'\n\t\t[4760] link '\\ue608 CATALOG'\n\t\t[4766] link '\\ue603 CUSTOMERS'\n\t\t[4772] link '\\ue609 MARKETING'\n\t\t[4778] link '\\ue602 CONTENT'\n\t\t[4784] link '\\ue60a REPORTS'\n\t\t[4802] link '\\ue60d STORES'\n\t\t[4808] link '\\ue610 SYSTEM'\n\t\t[4814] link '\\ue612 FIND PARTNERS & EXTENSIONS'\n\t[4916] heading 'Dashboard'\n\t[4918] link '\\ue600 admin'\n\t[4920] link '\\ue607'\n\t[5560] StaticText '\\ue60c'\n\t[5558] textbox '\\ue60c' required: False\n\t[4712] main ''\n\t\t[4897] StaticText 'Scope:'\n\t\t[4926] button 'All Store Views' hasPopup: menu\n\t\t[4929] link '\\ue633 What is this?'\n\t\t[4904] button 'Reload Data'\n\t\t[5562] HeaderAsNonLandmark ''\n\t\t\t[5564] StaticText 'Advanced Reporting'\n\t\t[5565] StaticText \"Gain new insights and take command of your business' performance, using our dynamic product, order, and customer reports tailored to your customer data.\"\n\t\t[5566] link 'Go to Advanced Reporting \\ue644'\n\t\t[5569] StaticText 'Chart is disabled.

        "content": "You are an autonomous intelligent agent tasked with navigating a web browser. You will be given web-based tasks. These tasks will be accomplished through the use of specific actions you can issue.\n\nHere's the information you'll have:\nThe user's objective: This is the task you're trying to complete.\nThe current web page's accessibility tree: This is a simplified representation of the webpage, providing key information.\nThe current web page's URL: This is the page you're currently navigating.\nThe open tabs: These are the tabs you have open.\nThe previous actions: These are all the action you have performed. It may be helpful to track your progress.\n\nThe actions you can perform fall into several categories:\n\nPage Operation Actions:\n`click [id]`: This action clicks on an element with a specific id on the webpage.\n`type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]`: Use this to type the content into the field with id. By default, the \"Enter\" key is pressed after typing unless press_enter_after is set to 0.\n`hover [id]`: Hover over an element with id.\n`press [key_comb]`:  Simulates the pressing of a key combination on the keyboard (e.g., Ctrl+v).\n`scroll [down|up]`: Scroll the page up or down.\n\nTab Management Actions:\n`new_tab`: Open a new, empty browser tab.\n`tab_focus [tab_index]`: Switch the browser's focus to a specific tab using its index.\n`close_tab`: Close the currently active tab.\n\nURL Navigation Actions:\n`goto [url]`: Navigate to a specific URL.\n`go_back`: Navigate to the previously viewed page.\n`go_forward`: Navigate to the next page (if a previous 'go_back' action was performed).\n\nCompletion Action:\n`stop [answer]`: Issue this action when you believe the task is complete. If the objective is to find a text-based answer, provide the answer in the bracket. If you believe the task is impossible to complete, provide the answer as \"N/A\" in the bracket.\n\nHomepage:\nIf you want to visit other websites, check out the homepage at http://homepage.com. It has a list of websites you can visit.\n\nTo be successful, it is very important to follow the following rules:\n1. You should only issue an action that is valid given the current observation\n2. You should only issue one action at a time.\n3. You should follow the examples to reason step by step and then issue the next action.\n4. You are strictly forbidden from issuing a goto action to a URL that is not on the homepage.\n5. Generate the action in the correct format. Start by reasoning about the current situation. End with \"In summary, the next action I will perform is\" phrase, followed by action inside ``````. For example, \"Let's think step-by-step. Given the current state, I need to click on the like button which has id 1234. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```click [1234]```\".\n6. Issue stop action when you think you have achieved the objective. Don't generate anything after stop. \n\nHere are some example outputs for some random tasks:\n1. Let's think step-by-step. This page list the information of HP Inkjet Fax Machine, which is the product identified in the objective. Its price is $279.49. I think I have achieved the objective. I will issue the stop action with the answer. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```stop [$279.49]```\n2. Let's think step-by-step. This page has a search box whose ID is [164]. According to the nominatim rule of openstreetmap, I can search for the restaurants near a location by \"restaurants near\". I can submit my typing by pressing the Enter afterwards. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```type [164] [restaurants near CMU] [1]```"

    "prompt": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\nYou are an autonomous intelligent agent tasked with navigating a web browser. You will be given web-based tasks. These tasks will be accomplished through the use of specific actions you can issue.\n\nHere's the information you'll have:\nThe user's objective: This is the task you're trying to complete.\nThe current web page's accessibility tree: This is a simplified representation of the webpage, providing key information.\nThe current web page's URL: This is the page you're currently navigating.\nThe open tabs: These are the tabs you have open.\nThe previous actions: These are all the action you have performed. It may be helpful to track your progress.\n\nThe actions you can perform fall into several categories:\n\nPage Operation Actions:\n`click [id]`: This action clicks on an element with a specific id on the webpage.\n`type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]`: Use this to type the content into the field with id. By default, the \"Enter\" key is pressed after typing unless press_enter_after is set to 0.\n`hover [id]`: Hover over an element with id.\n`press [key_comb]`:  Simulates the pressing of a key combination on the keyboard (e.g., Ctrl+v).\n`scroll [down|up]`: Scroll the page up or down.\n\nTab Management Actions:\n`new_tab`: Open a new, empty browser tab.\n`tab_focus [tab_index]`: Switch the browser's focus to a specific tab using its index.\n`close_tab`: Close the currently active tab.\n\nURL Navigation Actions:\n`goto [url]`: Navigate to a specific URL.\n`go_back`: Navigate to the previously viewed page.\n`go_forward`: Navigate to the next page (if a previous 'go_back' action was performed).\n\nCompletion Action:\n`stop [answer]`: Issue this action when you believe the task is complete. If the objective is to find a text-based answer, provide the answer in the bracket. If you believe the task is impossible to complete, provide the answer as \"N/A\" in the bracket.\n\nHomepage:\nIf you want to visit other websites, check out the homepage at http://homepage.com. It has a list of websites you can visit.\n\nTo be successful, it is very important to follow the following rules:\n1. You should only issue an action that is valid given the current observation\n2. You should only issue one action at a time.\n3. You should follow the examples to reason step by step and then issue the next action.\n4. You are strictly forbidden from issuing a goto action to a URL that is not on the homepage.\n5. Generate the action in the correct format. Start by reasoning about the current situation. End with \"In summary, the next action I will perform is\" phrase, followed by action inside ``````. For example, \"Let's think step-by-step. Given the current state, I need to click on the like button which has id 1234. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```click [1234]```\".\n6. Issue stop action when you think you have achieved the objective. Don't generate anything after stop. \n\nHere are some example outputs for some random tasks:\n1. Let's think step-by-step. This page list the information of HP Inkjet Fax Machine, which is the product identified in the objective. Its price is $279.49. I think I have achieved the objective. I will issue the stop action with the answer. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```stop [$279.49]```\n2. Let's think step-by-step. This page has a search box whose ID is [164]. According to the nominatim rule of openstreetmap, I can search for the restaurants near a location by \"restaurants near\". I can submit my typing by pressing the Enter afterwards. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```type [164] [restaurants near CMU] [1]```\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\nOBSERVATION:\nTab 0 (current): Dashboard / Magento Admin\n\n[4665] RootWebArea 'Dashboard / Magento Admin' focused: True\n\t[4842] link 'Magento Admin Panel'\n\t\t[4865] img 'Magento Admin Panel'\n\t[4749] menubar '' orientation: horizontal\n\t\t[4751] link '\\ue604 DASHBOARD'\n\t\t[4754] link '\\ue60b SALES'\n\t\t[4760] link '\\ue608 CATALOG'\n\t\t[4766] link '\\ue603 CUSTOMERS'\n\t\t[4772] link '\\ue609 MARKETING'\n\t\t[4778] link '\\ue602 CONTENT'\n\t\t[4784] link '\\ue60a REPORTS'\n\t\t[4802] link '\\ue60d STORES'\n\t\t[4808] link '\\ue610 SYSTEM'\n\t\t[4814] link '\\ue612 FIND PARTNERS & EXTENSIONS'\n\t[4916] heading 'Dashboard'\n\t[4918] link '\\ue600 admin'\n\t[4920] link '\\ue607'\n\t[5560] StaticText '\\ue60c'\n\t[5558] textbox '\\ue60c' required: False\n\t[4712] main ''\n\t\t[4897] StaticText 'Scope:'\n\t\t[4926] button 'All Store Views' hasPopup: menu\n\t\t[4929] link '\\ue633 What is this?'\n\t\t[4904] button 'Reload Data'\n\t\t[5562] HeaderAsNonLandmark ''\n\t\t\t[5564] StaticText 'Advanced Reporting'\n\t\t[5565] StaticText \"Gain new insights and take command of your business' performance, using our dynamic product, order, and customer reports tailored to your customer data.\"\n\t\t[5566] link 'Go to Advanced Reporting \\ue644'\n\t\t[5569] StaticText 'Chart is disabled.

        "content": "You are an autonomous intelligent agent tasked with navigating a web browser. You will be given web-based tasks. These tasks will be accomplished through the use of specific actions you can issue.\n\nHere's the information you'll have:\nThe user's objective: This is the task you're trying to complete.\nThe current web page's accessibility tree: This is a simplified representation of the webpage, providing key information.\nThe current web page's URL: This is the page you're currently navigating.\nThe open tabs: These are the tabs you have open.\nThe previous actions: These are all the action you have performed. It may be helpful to track your progress.\n\nThe actions you can perform fall into several categories:\n\nPage Operation Actions:\n`click [id]`: This action clicks on an element with a specific id on the webpage.\n`type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]`: Use this to type the content into the field with id. By default, the \"Enter\" key is pressed after typing unless press_enter_after is set to 0.\n`hover [id]`: Hover over an element with id.\n`press [key_comb]`:  Simulates the pressing of a key combination on the keyboard (e.g., Ctrl+v).\n`scroll [down|up]`: Scroll the page up or down.\n\nTab Management Actions:\n`new_tab`: Open a new, empty browser tab.\n`tab_focus [tab_index]`: Switch the browser's focus to a specific tab using its index.\n`close_tab`: Close the currently active tab.\n\nURL Navigation Actions:\n`goto [url]`: Navigate to a specific URL.\n`go_back`: Navigate to the previously viewed page.\n`go_forward`: Navigate to the next page (if a previous 'go_back' action was performed).\n\nCompletion Action:\n`stop [answer]`: Issue this action when you believe the task is complete. If the objective is to find a text-based answer, provide the answer in the bracket. If you believe the task is impossible to complete, provide the answer as \"N/A\" in the bracket.\n\nHomepage:\nIf you want to visit other websites, check out the homepage at http://homepage.com. It has a list of websites you can visit.\n\nTo be successful, it is very important to follow the following rules:\n1. You should only issue an action that is valid given the current observation\n2. You should only issue one action at a time.\n3. You should follow the examples to reason step by step and then issue the next action.\n4. You are strictly forbidden from issuing a goto action to a URL that is not on the homepage.\n5. Generate the action in the correct format. Start by reasoning about the current situation. End with \"In summary, the next action I will perform is\" phrase, followed by action inside ``````. For example, \"Let's think step-by-step. Given the current state, I need to click on the like button which has id 1234. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```click [1234]```\".\n6. Issue stop action when you think you have achieved the objective. Don't generate anything after stop. \n\nHere are some example outputs for some random tasks:\n1. Let's think step-by-step. This page list the information of HP Inkjet Fax Machine, which is the product identified in the objective. Its price is $279.49. I think I have achieved the objective. I will issue the stop action with the answer. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```stop [$279.49]```\n2. Let's think step-by-step. This page has a search box whose ID is [164]. According to the nominatim rule of openstreetmap, I can search for the restaurants near a location by \"restaurants near\". I can submit my typing by pressing the Enter afterwards. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```type [164] [restaurants near CMU] [1]```"

        "content": "You are an autonomous intelligent agent tasked with navigating a web browser. You will be given web-based tasks. These tasks will be accomplished through the use of specific actions you can issue.\n\nHere's the information you'll have:\nThe user's objective: This is the task you're trying to complete.\nThe current web page's accessibility tree: This is a simplified representation of the webpage, providing key information.\nThe current web page's URL: This is the page you're currently navigating.\nThe open tabs: These are the tabs you have open.\nThe previous actions: These are all the action you have performed. It may be helpful to track your progress.\n\nThe actions you can perform fall into several categories:\n\nPage Operation Actions:\n`click [id]`: This action clicks on an element with a specific id on the webpage.\n`type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]`: Use this to type the content into the field with id. By default, the \"Enter\" key is pressed after typing unless press_enter_after is set to 0.\n`hover [id]`: Hover over an element with id.\n`press [key_comb]`:  Simulates the pressing of a key combination on the keyboard (e.g., Ctrl+v).\n`scroll [down|up]`: Scroll the page up or down.\n\nTab Management Actions:\n`new_tab`: Open a new, empty browser tab.\n`tab_focus [tab_index]`: Switch the browser's focus to a specific tab using its index.\n`close_tab`: Close the currently active tab.\n\nURL Navigation Actions:\n`goto [url]`: Navigate to a specific URL.\n`go_back`: Navigate to the previously viewed page.\n`go_forward`: Navigate to the next page (if a previous 'go_back' action was performed).\n\nCompletion Action:\n`stop [answer]`: Issue this action when you believe the task is complete. If the objective is to find a text-based answer, provide the answer in the bracket. If you believe the task is impossible to complete, provide the answer as \"N/A\" in the bracket.\n\nHomepage:\nIf you want to visit other websites, check out the homepage at http://homepage.com. It has a list of websites you can visit.\n\nTo be successful, it is very important to follow the following rules:\n1. You should only issue an action that is valid given the current observation\n2. You should only issue one action at a time.\n3. You should follow the examples to reason step by step and then issue the next action.\n4. You are strictly forbidden from issuing a goto action to a URL that is not on the homepage.\n5. Generate the action in the correct format. Start by reasoning about the current situation. End with \"In summary, the next action I will perform is\" phrase, followed by action inside ``````. For example, \"Let's think step-by-step. Given the current state, I need to click on the like button which has id 1234. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```click [1234]```\".\n6. Issue stop action when you think you have achieved the objective. Don't generate anything after stop. \n\nHere are some example outputs for some random tasks:\n1. Let's think step-by-step.

    "prompt": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\nYou are an autonomous intelligent agent tasked with navigating a web browser. You will be given web-based tasks. These tasks will be accomplished through the use of specific actions you can issue.\n\nHere's the information you'll have:\nThe user's objective: This is the task you're trying to complete.\nThe current web page's accessibility tree: This is a simplified representation of the webpage, providing key information.\nThe current web page's URL: This is the page you're currently navigating.\nThe open tabs: These are the tabs you have open.\nThe previous actions: These are all the action you have performed. It may be helpful to track your progress.\n\nThe actions you can perform fall into several categories:\n\nPage Operation Actions:\n`click [id]`: This action clicks on an element with a specific id on the webpage.\n`type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]`: Use this to type the content into the field with id. By default, the \"Enter\" key is pressed after typing unless press_enter_after is set to 0.\n`hover [id]`: Hover over an element with id.\n`press [key_comb]`:  Simulates the pressing of a key combination on the keyboard (e.g., Ctrl+v).\n`scroll [down|up]`: Scroll the page up or down.\n\nTab Management Actions:\n`new_tab`: Open a new, empty browser tab.\n`tab_focus [tab_index]`: Switch the browser's focus to a specific tab using its index.\n`close_tab`: Close the currently active tab.\n\nURL Navigation Actions:\n`goto [url]`: Navigate to a specific URL.\n`go_back`: Navigate to the previously viewed page.\n`go_forward`: Navigate to the next page (if a previous 'go_back' action was performed).\n\nCompletion Action:\n`stop [answer]`: Issue this action when you believe the task is complete. If the objective is to find a text-based answer, provide the answer in the bracket. If you believe the task is impossible to complete, provide the answer as \"N/A\" in the bracket.\n\nHomepage:\nIf you want to visit other websites, check out the homepage at http://homepage.com. It has a list of websites you can visit.\n\nTo be successful, it is very important to follow the following rules:\n1. You should only issue an action that is valid given the current observation\n2. You should only issue one action at a time.\n3. You should follow the examples to reason step by step and then issue the next action.\n4. You are strictly forbidden from issuing a goto action to a URL that is not on the homepage.\n5. Generate the action in the correct format. Start by reasoning about the current situation. End with \"In summary, the next action I will perform is\" phrase, followed by action inside ``````. For example, \"Let's think step-by-step. Given the current state, I need to click on the like button which has id 1234. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```click [1234]```\".\n6. Issue stop action when you think you have achieved the objective. Don't generate anything after stop. \n\nHere are some example outputs for some random tasks:\n1. Let's think step-by-step. This page list the information of HP Inkjet Fax Machine, which is the product identified in the objective. Its price is $279.49. I think I have achieved the objective. I will issue the stop action with the answer. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```stop [$279.49]```\n2. Let's think step-by-step. This page has a search box whose ID is [164]. According to the nominatim rule of openstreetmap, I can search for the restaurants near a location by \"restaurants near\". I can submit my typing by pressing the Enter afterwards. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```type [164] [restaurants near CMU] [1]```\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\nOBSERVATION:\nTab 0 (current): Dashboard / Magento Admin\n\n[4665] RootWebArea 'Dashboard / Magento Admin' focused: True\n\t[4842] link 'Magento Admin Panel'\n\t\t[4865] img 'Magento Admin Panel'\n\t[4749] menubar '' orientation: horizontal\n\t\t[4751] link '\\ue604 DASHBOARD'\n\t\t[4754] link '\\ue60b SALES'\n\t\t[4760] link '\\ue608 CATALOG'\n\t\t[4766] link '\\ue603 CUSTOMERS'\n\t\t[4772] link '\\ue609 MARKETING'\n\t\t[4778] link '\\ue602 CONTENT'\n\t\t[4784] link '\\ue60a REPORTS'\n\t\t[4802] link '\\ue60d STORES'\n\t\t[4808] link '\\ue610 SYSTEM'\n\t\t[4814] link '\\ue612 FIND PARTNERS & EXTENSIONS'\n\t[4916] heading 'Dashboard'\n\t[4918] link '\\ue600 admin'\n\t[4920] link '\\ue607'\n\t[5560] StaticText '\\ue60c'\n\t[5558] textbox '\\ue60c' required: False\n\t[4712] main ''\n\t\t[4897] StaticText 'Scope:'\n\t\t[4926] button 'All Store Views' hasPopup: menu\n\t\t[4929] link '\\ue633 What is this?'\n\t\t[4904] button 'Reload Data'\n\t\t[5562] HeaderAsNonLandmark ''\n\t\t\t[5564] StaticText 'Advanced Reporting'\n\t\t[5565] StaticText \"Gain new insights and take command of your business' performance, using our dynamic product, order, and customer reports tailored to your customer data.\"\n\t\t[5566] link 'Go to Advanced Reporting \\ue644'\n\t\t[5569] StaticText 'Chart is disabled.

These tasks will be accomplished through the use of specific actions you can issue.\n\nHere's the information you'll have:\nThe user's objective: This is the task you're trying to complete.\nThe current web page's accessibility tree: This is a simplified representation of the webpage, providing key information.\nThe current web page's URL: This is the page you're currently navigating.\nThe open tabs: These are the tabs you have open.\nThe previous actions: These are all the action you have performed. It may be helpful to track your progress.\n\nThe actions you can perform fall into several categories:\n\nPage Operation Actions:\n`click [id]`: This action clicks on an element with a specific id on the webpage.\n`type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]`: Use this to type the content into the field with id. By default, the \"Enter\" key is pressed after typing unless press_enter_after is set to 0.\n`hover [id]`: Hover over an element with id.\n`press [key_comb]`:  Simulates the pressing of a key combination on the keyboard (e.g., Ctrl+v).\n`scroll [down|up]`: Scroll the page up or down.\n\nTab Management Actions:\n`new_tab`: Open a new, empty browser tab.\n`tab_focus [tab_index]`: Switch the browser's focus to a specific tab using its index.\n`close_tab`: Close the currently active tab.\n\nURL Navigation Actions:\n`goto [url]`: Navigate to a specific URL.\n`go_back`: Navigate to the previously viewed page.\n`go_forward`: Navigate to the next page (if a previous 'go_back' action was performed).\n\nCompletion Action:\n`stop [answer]`: Issue this action when you believe the task is complete. If the objective is to find a text-based answer, provide the answer in the bracket. If you believe the task is impossible to complete, provide the answer as \"N/A\" in the bracket.\n\nHomepage:\nIf you want to visit other websites, check out the homepage at http://homepage.com. It has a list of websites you can visit.\n\nTo be successful, it is very important to follow the following rules:\n1. You should only issue an action that is valid given the current observation\n2. You should only issue one action at a time.\n3. You should follow the examples to reason step by step and then issue the next action.\n4. You are strictly forbidden from issuing a goto action to a URL that is not on the homepage.\n5. Generate the action in the correct format. Start by reasoning about the current situation. End with \"In summary, the next action I will perform is\" phrase, followed by action inside ``````. For example, \"Let's think step-by-step. Given the current state, I need to click on the like button which has id 1234. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```click [1234]```\".\n6. Issue stop action when you think you have achieved the objective. Don't generate anything after stop. \n\nHere are some example outputs for some random tasks:\n1. Let's think step-by-step. This page list the information of HP Inkjet Fax Machine, which is the product identified in the objective. Its price is $279.49. I think I have achieved the objective. I will issue the stop action with the answer. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```stop [$279.49]```\n2. Let's think step-by-step. This page has a search box whose ID is [164]. According to the nominatim rule of openstreetmap, I can search for the restaurants near a location by \"restaurants near\". I can submit my typing by pressing the Enter afterwards. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```type [164] [restaurants near CMU] [1]```"

    "prompt": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\nYou are an autonomous intelligent agent tasked with navigating a web browser. You will be given web-based tasks. These tasks will be accomplished through the use of specific actions you can issue.\n\nHere's the information you'll have:\nThe user's objective: This is the task you're trying to complete.\nThe current web page's accessibility tree: This is a simplified representation of the webpage, providing key information.\nThe current web page's URL: This is the page you're currently navigating.\nThe open tabs: These are the tabs you have open.\nThe previous actions: These are all the action you have performed. It may be helpful to track your progress.\n\nThe actions you can perform fall into several categories:\n\nPage Operation Actions:\n`click [id]`: This action clicks on an element with a specific id on the webpage.\n`type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]`: Use this to type the content into the field with id. By default, the \"Enter\" key is pressed after typing unless press_enter_after is set to 0.\n`hover [id]`: Hover over an element with id.\n`press [key_comb]`:  Simulates the pressing of a key combination on the keyboard (e.g., Ctrl+v).\n`scroll [down|up]`: Scroll the page up or down.\n\nTab Management Actions:\n`new_tab`: Open a new, empty browser tab.\n`tab_focus [tab_index]`: Switch the browser's focus to a specific tab using its index.\n`close_tab`: Close the currently active tab.\n\nURL Navigation Actions:\n`goto [url]`: Navigate to a specific URL.\n`go_back`: Navigate to the previously viewed page.\n`go_forward`: Navigate to the next page (if a previous 'go_back' action was performed).\n\nCompletion Action:\n`stop [answer]`: Issue this action when you believe the task is complete. If the objective is to find a text-based answer, provide the answer in the bracket. If you believe the task is impossible to complete, provide the answer as \"N/A\" in the bracket.\n\nHomepage:\nIf you want to visit other websites, check out the homepage at http://homepage.com. It has a list of websites you can visit.\n\nTo be successful, it is very important to follow the following rules:\n1. You should only issue an action that is valid given the current observation\n2. You should only issue one action at a time.\n3. You should follow the examples to reason step by step and then issue the next action.\n4. You are strictly forbidden from issuing a goto action to a URL that is not on the homepage.\n5. Generate the action in the correct format. Start by reasoning about the current situation. End with \"In summary, the next action I will perform is\" phrase, followed by action inside ``````. For example, \"Let's think step-by-step. Given the current state, I need to click on the like button which has id 1234. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```click [1234]```\".\n6. Issue stop action when you think you have achieved the objective. Don't generate anything after stop. \n\nHere are some example outputs for some random tasks:\n1. Let's think step-by-step. This page list the information of HP Inkjet Fax Machine, which is the product identified in the objective. Its price is $279.49. I think I have achieved the objective. I will issue the stop action with the answer. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```stop [$279.49]```\n2. Let's think step-by-step. This page has a search box whose ID is [164]. According to the nominatim rule of openstreetmap, I can search for the restaurants near a location by \"restaurants near\". I can submit my typing by pressing the Enter afterwards. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```type [164] [restaurants near CMU] [1]```\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\nOBSERVATION:\nTab 0 (current): Quest Lumaflex™ Band /

        "content": "You are an autonomous intelligent agent tasked with navigating a web browser. You will be given web-based tasks. These tasks will be accomplished through the use of specific actions you can issue.\n\nHere's the information you'll have:\nThe user's objective: This is the task you're trying to complete.\nThe current web page's accessibility tree: This is a simplified representation of the webpage, providing key information.\nThe current web page's URL: This is the page you're currently navigating.\nThe open tabs: These are the tabs you have open.\nThe previous actions: These are all the action you have performed. It may be helpful to track your progress.\n\nThe actions you can perform fall into several categories:\n\nPage Operation Actions:\n`click [id]`: This action clicks on an element with a specific id on the webpage.\n`type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]`: Use this to type the content into the field with id. By default, the \"Enter\" key is pressed after typing unless press_enter_after is set to 0.\n`hover [id]`: Hover over an element with id.\n`press [key_comb]`:  Simulates the pressing of a key combination on the keyboard (e.g., Ctrl+v).\n`scroll [down|up]`: Scroll the page up or down.\n\nTab Management Actions:\n`new_tab`: Open a new, empty browser tab.\n`tab_focus [tab_index]`: Switch the browser's focus to a specific tab using its index.\n`close_tab`: Close the currently active tab.\n\nURL Navigation Actions:\n`goto [url]`: Navigate to a specific URL.\n`go_back`: Navigate to the previously viewed page.\n`go_forward`: Navigate to the next page (if a previous 'go_back' action was performed).\n\nCompletion Action:\n`stop [answer]`: Issue this action when you believe the task is complete. If the objective is to find a text-based answer, provide the answer in the bracket. If you believe the task is impossible to complete, provide the answer as \"N/A\" in the bracket.\n\nHomepage:\nIf you want to visit other websites, check out the homepage at http://homepage.com. It has a list of websites you can visit.\n\nTo be successful, it is very important to follow the following rules:\n1. You should only issue an action that is valid given the current observation\n2. You should only issue one action at a time.\n3. You should follow the examples to reason step by step and then issue the next action.\n4. You are strictly forbidden from issuing a goto action to a URL that is not on the homepage.\n5. Generate the action in the correct format. Start by reasoning about the current situation. End with \"In summary, the next action I will perform is\" phrase, followed by action inside ``````. For example, \"Let's think step-by-step. Given the current state, I need to click on the like button which has id 1234. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```click [1234]```\".\n6. Issue stop action when you think you have achieved the objective. Don't generate anything after stop. \n\nHere are some example outputs for some random tasks:\n1. Let's think step-by-step. This page list the information of HP Inkjet Fax Machine, which is the product identified in the objective. Its price is $279.49. I think I have achieved the objective. I will issue the stop action with the answer. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```stop [$279.49]```\n2. Let's think step-by-step. This page has a search box whose ID is [164]. According to the nominatim rule of openstreetmap, I can search for the restaurants near a location by \"restaurants near\". I can submit my typing by pressing the Enter afterwards. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```type [164] [restaurants near CMU] [1]```"

These tasks will be accomplished through the use of specific actions you can issue.\n\nHere's the information you'll have:\nThe user's objective: This is the task you're trying to complete.\nThe current web page's accessibility tree: This is a simplified representation of the webpage, providing key information.\nThe current web page's URL: This is the page you're currently navigating.\nThe open tabs: These are the tabs you have open.\nThe previous actions: These are all the action you have performed. It may be helpful to track your progress.\n\nThe actions you can perform fall into several categories:\n\nPage Operation Actions:\n`click [id]`: This action clicks on an element with a specific id on the webpage.\n`type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]`: Use this to type the content into the field with id. By default, the \"Enter\" key is pressed after typing unless press_enter_after is set to 0.\n`hover [id]`: Hover over an element with id.\n`press [key_comb]`:  Simulates the pressing of a key combination on the keyboard (e.g., Ctrl+v).\n`scroll [down|up]`: Scroll the page up or down.\n\nTab Management Actions:\n`new_tab`: Open a new, empty browser tab.\n`tab_focus [tab_index]`: Switch the browser's focus to a specific tab using its index.\n`close_tab`: Close the currently active tab.\n\nURL Navigation Actions:\n`goto [url]`: Navigate to a specific URL.\n`go_back`: Navigate to the previously viewed page.\n`go_forward`: Navigate to the next page (if a previous 'go_back' action was performed).\n\nCompletion Action:\n`stop [answer]`: Issue this action when you believe the task is complete. If the objective is to find a text-based answer, provide the answer in the bracket. If you believe the task is impossible to complete, provide the answer as \"N/A\" in the bracket.\n\nHomepage:\nIf you want to visit other websites, check out the homepage at http://homepage.com. It has a list of websites you can visit.\n\nTo be successful, it is very important to follow the following rules:\n1. You should only issue an action that is valid given the current observation\n2. You should only issue one action at a time.\n3. You should follow the examples to reason step by step and then issue the next action.\n4. You are strictly forbidden from issuing a goto action to a URL that is not on the homepage.\n5. Generate the action in the correct format. Start by reasoning about the current situation. End with \"In summary, the next action I will perform is\" phrase, followed by action inside ``````. For example, \"Let's think step-by-step. Given the current state, I need to click on the like button which has id 1234. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```click [1234]```\".\n6. Issue stop action when you think you have achieved the objective. Don't generate anything after stop. \n\nHere are some example outputs for some random tasks:\n1. Let's think step-by-step. This page list the information of HP Inkjet Fax Machine, which is the product identified in the objective. Its price is $279.49. I think I have achieved the objective. I will issue the stop action with the answer. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```stop [$279.49]```\n2. Let's think step-by-step. This page has a search box whose ID is [164]. According to the nominatim rule of openstreetmap, I can search for the restaurants near a location by \"restaurants near\". I can submit my typing by pressing the Enter afterwards. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```type [164] [restaurants near CMU] [1]```\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\nOBSERVATION:\nTab 0 (current): Quest Lumaflex™ Band /

        "content": "You are an autonomous intelligent agent tasked with navigating a web browser. You will be given web-based tasks. These tasks will be accomplished through the use of specific actions you can issue.\n\nHere's the information you'll have:\nThe user's objective: This is the task you're trying to complete.\nThe current web page's accessibility tree: This is a simplified representation of the webpage, providing key information.\nThe current web page's URL: This is the page you're currently navigating.\nThe open tabs: These are the tabs you have open.\nThe previous actions: These are all the action you have performed. It may be helpful to track your progress.\n\nThe actions you can perform fall into several categories:\n\nPage Operation Actions:\n`click [id]`: This action clicks on an element with a specific id on the webpage.\n`type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]`: Use this to type the content into the field with id. By default, the \"Enter\" key is pressed after typing unless press_enter_after is set to 0.\n`hover [id]`: Hover over an element with id.\n`press [key_comb]`:  Simulates the pressing of a key combination on the keyboard (e.g., Ctrl+v).\n`scroll [down|up]`: Scroll the page up or down.\n\nTab Management Actions:\n`new_tab`: Open a new, empty browser tab.\n`tab_focus [tab_index]`: Switch the browser's focus to a specific tab using its index.\n`close_tab`: Close the currently active tab.\n\nURL Navigation Actions:\n`goto [url]`: Navigate to a specific URL.\n`go_back`: Navigate to the previously viewed page.\n`go_forward`: Navigate to the next page (if a previous 'go_back' action was performed).\n\nCompletion Action:\n`stop [answer]`: Issue this action when you believe the task is complete. If the objective is to find a text-based answer, provide the answer in the bracket. If you believe the task is impossible to complete, provide the answer as \"N/A\" in the bracket.\n\nHomepage:\nIf you want to visit other websites, check out the homepage at http://homepage.com. It has a list of websites you can visit.\n\nTo be successful, it is very important to follow the following rules:\n1. You should only issue an action that is valid given the current observation\n2. You should only issue one action at a time.\n3. You should follow the examples to reason step by step and then issue the next action.\n4. You are strictly forbidden from issuing a goto action to a URL that is not on the homepage.\n5. Generate the action in the correct format. Start by reasoning about the current situation. End with \"In summary, the next action I will perform is\" phrase, followed by action inside ``````. For example, \"Let's think step-by-step. Given the current state, I need to click on the like button which has id 1234. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```click [1234]```\".\n6. Issue stop action when you think you have achieved the objective. Don't generate anything after stop. \n\nHere are some example outputs for some random tasks:\n1. Let's think step-by-step. This page list the information of HP Inkjet Fax Machine, which is the product identified in the objective. Its price is $279.49. I think I have achieved the objective. I will issue the stop action with the answer. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```stop [$279.49]```\n2. Let's think step-by-step. This page has a search box whose ID is [164]. According to the nominatim rule of openstreetmap, I can search for the restaurants near a location by \"restaurants near\". I can submit my typing by pressing the Enter afterwards. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```type [164] [restaurants near CMU] [1]```"

    "prompt": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\nYou are an autonomous intelligent agent tasked with navigating a web browser. You will be given web-based tasks. These tasks will be accomplished through the use of specific actions you can issue.\n\nHere's the information you'll have:\nThe user's objective: This is the task you're trying to complete.\nThe current web page's accessibility tree: This is a simplified representation of the webpage, providing key information.\nThe current web page's URL: This is the page you're currently navigating.\nThe open tabs: These are the tabs you have open.\nThe previous actions: These are all the action you have performed. It may be helpful to track your progress.\n\nThe actions you can perform fall into several categories:\n\nPage Operation Actions:\n`click [id]`: This action clicks on an element with a specific id on the webpage.\n`type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]`: Use this to type the content into the field with id. By default, the \"Enter\" key is pressed after typing unless press_enter_after is set to 0.\n`hover [id]`: Hover over an element with id.\n`press [key_comb]`:  Simulates the pressing of a key combination on the keyboard (e.g., Ctrl+v).\n`scroll [down|up]`: Scroll the page up or down.\n\nTab Management Actions:\n`new_tab`: Open a new, empty browser tab.\n`tab_focus [tab_index]`: Switch the browser's focus to a specific tab using its index.\n`close_tab`: Close the currently active tab.\n\nURL Navigation Actions:\n`goto [url]`: Navigate to a specific URL.\n`go_back`: Navigate to the previously viewed page.\n`go_forward`: Navigate to the next page (if a previous 'go_back' action was performed).\n\nCompletion Action:\n`stop [answer]`: Issue this action when you believe the task is complete. If the objective is to find a text-based answer, provide the answer in the bracket. If you believe the task is impossible to complete, provide the answer as \"N/A\" in the bracket.\n\nHomepage:\nIf you want to visit other websites, check out the homepage at http://homepage.com. It has a list of websites you can visit.\n\nTo be successful, it is very important to follow the following rules:\n1. You should only issue an action that is valid given the current observation\n2. You should only issue one action at a time.\n3. You should follow the examples to reason step by step and then issue the next action.\n4. You are strictly forbidden from issuing a goto action to a URL that is not on the homepage.\n5. Generate the action in the correct format. Start by reasoning about the current situation. End with \"In summary, the next action I will perform is\" phrase, followed by action inside ``````. For example, \"Let's think step-by-step. Given the current state, I need to click on the like button which has id 1234. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```click [1234]```\".\n6. Issue stop action when you think you have achieved the objective. Don't generate anything after stop. \n\nHere are some example outputs for some random tasks:\n1. Let's think step-by-step. This page list the information of HP Inkjet Fax Machine, which is the product identified in the objective. Its price is $279.49. I think I have achieved the objective. I will issue the stop action with the answer. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```stop [$279.49]```\n2. Let's think step-by-step. This page has a search box whose ID is [164]. According to the nominatim rule of openstreetmap, I can search for the restaurants near a location by \"restaurants near\". I can submit my typing by pressing the Enter afterwards. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```type [164] [restaurants near CMU] [1]```\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\nOBSERVATION:\nTab 0 (current): Quest Lumaflex™ Band /

        "content": "You are an autonomous intelligent agent tasked with navigating a web browser. You will be given web-based tasks. These tasks will be accomplished through the use of specific actions you can issue.\n\nHere's the information you'll have:\nThe user's objective: This is the task you're trying to complete.\nThe current web page's accessibility tree: This is a simplified representation of the webpage, providing key information.\nThe current web page's URL: This is the page you're currently navigating.\nThe open tabs: These are the tabs you have open.\nThe previous actions: These are all the action you have performed. It may be helpful to track your progress.\n\nThe actions you can perform fall into several categories:\n\nPage Operation Actions:\n`click [id]`: This action clicks on an element with a specific id on the webpage.\n`type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]`: Use this to type the content into the field with id. By default, the \"Enter\" key is pressed after typing unless press_enter_after is set to 0.\n`hover [id]`: Hover over an element with id.\n`press [key_comb]`:  Simulates the pressing of a key combination on the keyboard (e.g., Ctrl+v).\n`scroll [down|up]`: Scroll the page up or down.\n\nTab Management Actions:\n`new_tab`: Open a new, empty browser tab.\n`tab_focus [tab_index]`: Switch the browser's focus to a specific tab using its index.\n`close_tab`: Close the currently active tab.\n\nURL Navigation Actions:\n`goto [url]`: Navigate to a specific URL.\n`go_back`: Navigate to the previously viewed page.\n`go_forward`: Navigate to the next page (if a previous 'go_back' action was performed).\n\nCompletion Action:\n`stop [answer]`: Issue this action when you believe the task is complete. If the objective is to find a text-based answer, provide the answer in the bracket. If you believe the task is impossible to complete, provide the answer as \"N/A\" in the bracket.\n\nHomepage:\nIf you want to visit other websites, check out the homepage at http://homepage.com. It has a list of websites you can visit.\n\nTo be successful, it is very important to follow the following rules:\n1. You should only issue an action that is valid given the current observation\n2. You should only issue one action at a time.\n3. You should follow the examples to reason step by step and then issue the next action.\n4. You are strictly forbidden from issuing a goto action to a URL that is not on the homepage.\n5. Generate the action in the correct format. Start by reasoning about the current situation. End with \"In summary, the next action I will perform is\" phrase, followed by action inside ``````. For example, \"Let's think step-by-step. Given the current state, I need to click on the like button which has id 1234. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```click [1234]```\".\n6. Issue stop action when you think you have achieved the objective. Don't generate anything after stop. \n\nHere are some example outputs for some random tasks:\n1. Let's think step-by-step. This page list the information of HP Inkjet Fax Machine, which is the product identified in the objective. Its price is $279.49. I think I have achieved the objective. I will issue the stop action with the answer. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```stop [$279.49]```\n2. Let's think step-by-step. This page has a search box whose ID is [164]. According to the nominatim rule of openstreetmap, I can search for the restaurants near a location by \"restaurants near\". I can submit my typing by pressing the Enter afterwards. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```type [164] [restaurants near CMU] [1]```"

    "prompt": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\nYou are an autonomous intelligent agent tasked with navigating a web browser. You will be given web-based tasks. These tasks will be accomplished through the use of specific actions you can issue.\n\nHere's the information you'll have:\nThe user's objective: This is the task you're trying to complete.\nThe current web page's accessibility tree: This is a simplified representation of the webpage, providing key information.\nThe current web page's URL: This is the page you're currently navigating.\nThe open tabs: These are the tabs you have open.\nThe previous actions: These are all the action you have performed. It may be helpful to track your progress.\n\nThe actions you can perform fall into several categories:\n\nPage Operation Actions:\n`click [id]`: This action clicks on an element with a specific id on the webpage.\n`type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]`: Use this to type the content into the field with id. By default, the \"Enter\" key is pressed after typing unless press_enter_after is set to 0.\n`hover [id]`: Hover over an element with id.\n`press [key_comb]`:  Simulates the pressing of a key combination on the keyboard (e.g., Ctrl+v).\n`scroll [down|up]`: Scroll the page up or down.\n\nTab Management Actions:\n`new_tab`: Open a new, empty browser tab.\n`tab_focus [tab_index]`: Switch the browser's focus to a specific tab using its index.\n`close_tab`: Close the currently active tab.\n\nURL Navigation Actions:\n`goto [url]`: Navigate to a specific URL.\n`go_back`: Navigate to the previously viewed page.\n`go_forward`: Navigate to the next page (if a previous 'go_back' action was performed).\n\nCompletion Action:\n`stop [answer]`: Issue this action when you believe the task is complete. If the objective is to find a text-based answer, provide the answer in the bracket. If you believe the task is impossible to complete, provide the answer as \"N/A\" in the bracket.\n\nHomepage:\nIf you want to visit other websites, check out the homepage at http://homepage.com. It has a list of websites you can visit.\n\nTo be successful, it is very important to follow the following rules:\n1. You should only issue an action that is valid given the current observation\n2. You should only issue one action at a time.\n3. You should follow the examples to reason step by step and then issue the next action.\n4. You are strictly forbidden from issuing a goto action to a URL that is not on the homepage.\n5. Generate the action in the correct format. Start by reasoning about the current situation. End with \"In summary, the next action I will perform is\" phrase, followed by action inside ``````. For example, \"Let's think step-by-step. Given the current state, I need to click on the like button which has id 1234. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```click [1234]```\".\n6. Issue stop action when you think you have achieved the objective. Don't generate anything after stop. \n\nHere are some example outputs for some random tasks:\n1. Let's think step-by-step. This page list the information of HP Inkjet Fax Machine, which is the product identified in the objective. Its price is $279.49. I think I have achieved the objective. I will issue the stop action with the answer. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```stop [$279.49]```\n2. Let's think step-by-step. This page has a search box whose ID is [164]. According to the nominatim rule of openstreetmap, I can search for the restaurants near a location by \"restaurants near\". I can submit my typing by pressing the Enter afterwards. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```type [164] [restaurants near CMU] [1]```\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\nOBSERVATION:\nTab 0 (current): Quest Lumaflex™ Band /

        "content": "You are an autonomous intelligent agent tasked with navigating a web browser. You will be given web-based tasks. These tasks will be accomplished through the use of specific actions you can issue.\n\nHere's the information you'll have:\nThe user's objective: This is the task you're trying to complete.\nThe current web page's accessibility tree: This is a simplified representation of the webpage, providing key information.\nThe current web page's URL: This is the page you're currently navigating.\nThe open tabs: These are the tabs you have open.\nThe previous actions: These are all the action you have performed. It may be helpful to track your progress.\n\nThe actions you can perform fall into several categories:\n\nPage Operation Actions:\n`click [id]`: This action clicks on an element with a specific id on the webpage.\n`type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]`: Use this to type the content into the field with id. By default, the \"Enter\" key is pressed after typing unless press_enter_after is set to 0.\n`hover [id]`: Hover over an element with id.\n`press [key_comb]`:  Simulates the pressing of a key combination on the keyboard (e.g., Ctrl+v).\n`scroll [down|up]`: Scroll the page up or down.\n\nTab Management Actions:\n`new_tab`: Open a new, empty browser tab.\n`tab_focus [tab_index]`: Switch the browser's focus to a specific tab using its index.\n`close_tab`: Close the currently active tab.\n\nURL Navigation Actions:\n`goto [url]`: Navigate to a specific URL.\n`go_back`: Navigate to the previously viewed page.\n`go_forward`: Navigate to the next page (if a previous 'go_back' action was performed).\n\nCompletion Action:\n`stop [answer]`: Issue this action when you believe the task is complete. If the objective is to find a text-based answer, provide the answer in the bracket. If you believe the task is impossible to complete, provide the answer as \"N/A\" in the bracket.\n\nHomepage:\nIf you want to visit other websites, check out the homepage at http://homepage.com. It has a list of websites you can visit.\n\nTo be successful, it is very important to follow the following rules:\n1. You should only issue an action that is valid given the current observation\n2. You should only issue one action at a time.\n3. You should follow the examples to reason step by step and then issue the next action.\n4. You are strictly forbidden from issuing a goto action to a URL that is not on the homepage.\n5. Generate the action in the correct format. Start by reasoning about the current situation. End with \"In summary, the next action I will perform is\" phrase, followed by action inside ``````. For example, \"Let's think step-by-step. Given the current state, I need to click on the like button which has id 1234. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```click [1234]```\".\n6. Issue stop action when you think you have achieved the objective. Don't generate anything after stop. \n\nHere are some example outputs for some random tasks:\n1. Let's think step-by-step. This page list the information of HP Inkjet Fax Machine, which is the product identified in the objective. Its price is $279.49. I think I have achieved the objective. I will issue the stop action with the answer. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```stop [$279.49]```\n2. Let's think step-by-step. This page has a search box whose ID is [164]. According to the nominatim rule of openstreetmap, I can search for the restaurants near a location by \"restaurants near\". I can submit my typing by pressing the Enter afterwards. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```type [164] [restaurants near CMU] [1]```"

    "prompt": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\nYou are an autonomous intelligent agent tasked with navigating a web browser. You will be given web-based tasks. These tasks will be accomplished through the use of specific actions you can issue.\n\nHere's the information you'll have:\nThe user's objective: This is the task you're trying to complete.\nThe current web page's accessibility tree: This is a simplified representation of the webpage, providing key information.\nThe current web page's URL: This is the page you're currently navigating.\nThe open tabs: These are the tabs you have open.\nThe previous actions: These are all the action you have performed. It may be helpful to track your progress.\n\nThe actions you can perform fall into several categories:\n\nPage Operation Actions:\n`click [id]`: This action clicks on an element with a specific id on the webpage.\n`type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]`: Use this to type the content into the field with id. By default, the \"Enter\" key is pressed after typing unless press_enter_after is set to 0.\n`hover [id]`: Hover over an element with id.\n`press [key_comb]`:  Simulates the pressing of a key combination on the keyboard (e.g., Ctrl+v).\n`scroll [down|up]`: Scroll the page up or down.\n\nTab Management Actions:\n`new_tab`: Open a new, empty browser tab.\n`tab_focus [tab_index]`: Switch the browser's focus to a specific tab using its index.\n`close_tab`: Close the currently active tab.\n\nURL Navigation Actions:\n`goto [url]`: Navigate to a specific URL.\n`go_back`: Navigate to the previously viewed page.\n`go_forward`: Navigate to the next page (if a previous 'go_back' action was performed).\n\nCompletion Action:\n`stop [answer]`: Issue this action when you believe the task is complete. If the objective is to find a text-based answer, provide the answer in the bracket. If you believe the task is impossible to complete, provide the answer as \"N/A\" in the bracket.\n\nHomepage:\nIf you want to visit other websites, check out the homepage at http://homepage.com. It has a list of websites you can visit.\n\nTo be successful, it is very important to follow the following rules:\n1. You should only issue an action that is valid given the current observation\n2. You should only issue one action at a time.\n3. You should follow the examples to reason step by step and then issue the next action.\n4. You are strictly forbidden from issuing a goto action to a URL that is not on the homepage.\n5. Generate the action in the correct format. Start by reasoning about the current situation. End with \"In summary, the next action I will perform is\" phrase, followed by action inside ``````. For example, \"Let's think step-by-step. Given the current state, I need to click on the like button which has id 1234. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```click [1234]```\".\n6. Issue stop action when you think you have achieved the objective. Don't generate anything after stop. \n\nHere are some example outputs for some random tasks:\n1. Let's think step-by-step. This page list the information of HP Inkjet Fax Machine, which is the product identified in the objective. Its price is $279.49. I think I have achieved the objective. I will issue the stop action with the answer. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```stop [$279.49]```\n2. Let's think step-by-step. This page has a search box whose ID is [164]. According to the nominatim rule of openstreetmap, I can search for the restaurants near a location by \"restaurants near\". I can submit my typing by pressing the Enter afterwards. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```type [164] [restaurants near CMU] [1]```\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\nOBSERVATION:\nTab 0 (current): Quest Lumaflex™ Band /

        "content": "You are an autonomous intelligent agent tasked with navigating a web browser. You will be given web-based tasks. These tasks will be accomplished through the use of specific actions you can issue.\n\nHere's the information you'll have:\nThe user's objective: This is the task you're trying to complete.\nThe current web page's accessibility tree: This is a simplified representation of the webpage, providing key information.\nThe current web page's URL: This is the page you're currently navigating.\nThe open tabs: These are the tabs you have open.\nThe previous actions: These are all the action you have performed. It may be helpful to track your progress.\n\nThe actions you can perform fall into several categories:\n\nPage Operation Actions:\n`click [id]`: This action clicks on an element with a specific id on the webpage.\n`type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]`: Use this to type the content into the field with id. By default, the \"Enter\" key is pressed after typing unless press_enter_after is set to 0.\n`hover [id]`: Hover over an element with id.\n`press [key_comb]`:  Simulates the pressing of a key combination on the keyboard (e.g., Ctrl+v).\n`scroll [down|up]`: Scroll the page up or down.\n\nTab Management Actions:\n`new_tab`: Open a new, empty browser tab.\n`tab_focus [tab_index]`: Switch the browser's focus to a specific tab using its index.\n`close_tab`: Close the currently active tab.\n\nURL Navigation Actions:\n`goto [url]`: Navigate to a specific URL.\n`go_back`: Navigate to the previously viewed page.\n`go_forward`: Navigate to the next page (if a previous 'go_back' action was performed).\n\nCompletion Action:\n`stop [answer]`: Issue this action when you believe the task is complete. If the objective is to find a text-based answer, provide the answer in the bracket. If you believe the task is impossible to complete, provide the answer as \"N/A\" in the bracket.\n\nHomepage:\nIf you want to visit other websites, check out the homepage at http://homepage.com. It has a list of websites you can visit.\n\nTo be successful, it is very important to follow the following rules:\n1. You should only issue an action that is valid given the current observation\n2. You should only issue one action at a time.\n3. You should follow the examples to reason step by step and then issue the next action.\n4. You are strictly forbidden from issuing a goto action to a URL that is not on the homepage.\n5. Generate the action in the correct format. Start by reasoning about the current situation. End with \"In summary, the next action I will perform is\" phrase, followed by action inside ``````. For example, \"Let's think step-by-step. Given the current state, I need to click on the like button which has id 1234. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```click [1234]```\".\n6. Issue stop action when you think you have achieved the objective. Don't generate anything after stop. \n\nHere are some example outputs for some random tasks:\n1. Let's think step-by-step. This page list the information of HP Inkjet Fax Machine, which is the product identified in the objective. Its price is $279.49. I think I have achieved the objective. I will issue the stop action with the answer. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```stop [$279.49]```\n2. Let's think step-by-step. This page has a search box whose ID is [164]. According to the nominatim rule of openstreetmap, I can search for the restaurants near a location by \"restaurants near\". I can submit my typing by pressing the Enter afterwards. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```type [164] [restaurants near CMU] [1]```"

    "prompt": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\nYou are an autonomous intelligent agent tasked with navigating a web browser. You will be given web-based tasks. These tasks will be accomplished through the use of specific actions you can issue.\n\nHere's the information you'll have:\nThe user's objective: This is the task you're trying to complete.\nThe current web page's accessibility tree: This is a simplified representation of the webpage, providing key information.\nThe current web page's URL: This is the page you're currently navigating.\nThe open tabs: These are the tabs you have open.\nThe previous actions: These are all the action you have performed. It may be helpful to track your progress.\n\nThe actions you can perform fall into several categories:\n\nPage Operation Actions:\n`click [id]`: This action clicks on an element with a specific id on the webpage.\n`type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]`: Use this to type the content into the field with id. By default, the \"Enter\" key is pressed after typing unless press_enter_after is set to 0.\n`hover [id]`: Hover over an element with id.\n`press [key_comb]`:  Simulates the pressing of a key combination on the keyboard (e.g., Ctrl+v).\n`scroll [down|up]`: Scroll the page up or down.\n\nTab Management Actions:\n`new_tab`: Open a new, empty browser tab.\n`tab_focus [tab_index]`: Switch the browser's focus to a specific tab using its index.\n`close_tab`: Close the currently active tab.\n\nURL Navigation Actions:\n`goto [url]`: Navigate to a specific URL.\n`go_back`: Navigate to the previously viewed page.\n`go_forward`: Navigate to the next page (if a previous 'go_back' action was performed).\n\nCompletion Action:\n`stop [answer]`: Issue this action when you believe the task is complete. If the objective is to find a text-based answer, provide the answer in the bracket. If you believe the task is impossible to complete, provide the answer as \"N/A\" in the bracket.\n\nHomepage:\nIf you want to visit other websites, check out the homepage at http://homepage.com. It has a list of websites you can visit.\n\nTo be successful, it is very important to follow the following rules:\n1. You should only issue an action that is valid given the current observation\n2. You should only issue one action at a time.\n3. You should follow the examples to reason step by step and then issue the next action.\n4. You are strictly forbidden from issuing a goto action to a URL that is not on the homepage.\n5. Generate the action in the correct format. Start by reasoning about the current situation. End with \"In summary, the next action I will perform is\" phrase, followed by action inside ``````. For example, \"Let's think step-by-step.

        "content": "You are an autonomous intelligent agent tasked with navigating a web browser. You will be given web-based tasks. These tasks will be accomplished through the use of specific actions you can issue.\n\nHere's the information you'll have:\nThe user's objective: This is the task you're trying to complete.\nThe current web page's accessibility tree: This is a simplified representation of the webpage, providing key information.\nThe current web page's URL: This is the page you're currently navigating.\nThe open tabs: These are the tabs you have open.\nThe previous actions: These are all the action you have performed. It may be helpful to track your progress.\n\nThe actions you can perform fall into several categories:\n\nPage Operation Actions:\n`click [id]`: This action clicks on an element with a specific id on the webpage.\n`type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]`: Use this to type the content into the field with id. By default, the \"Enter\" key is pressed after typing unless press_enter_after is set to 0.\n`hover [id]`: Hover over an element with id.\n`press [key_comb]`:  Simulates the pressing of a key combination on the keyboard (e.g., Ctrl+v).\n`scroll [down|up]`: Scroll the page up or down.\n\nTab Management Actions:\n`new_tab`: Open a new, empty browser tab.\n`tab_focus [tab_index]`: Switch the browser's focus to a specific tab using its index.\n`close_tab`: Close the currently active tab.\n\nURL Navigation Actions:\n`goto [url]`: Navigate to a specific URL.\n`go_back`: Navigate to the previously viewed page.\n`go_forward`: Navigate to the next page (if a previous 'go_back' action was performed).\n\nCompletion Action:\n`stop [answer]`: Issue this action when you believe the task is complete. If the objective is to find a text-based answer, provide the answer in the bracket. If you believe the task is impossible to complete, provide the answer as \"N/A\" in the bracket.\n\nHomepage:\nIf you want to visit other websites, check out the homepage at http://homepage.com. It has a list of websites you can visit.\n\nTo be successful, it is very important to follow the following rules:\n1. You should only issue an action that is valid given the current observation\n2. You should only issue one action at a time.\n3. You should follow the examples to reason step by step and then issue the next action.\n4. You are strictly forbidden from issuing a goto action to a URL that is not on the homepage.\n5. Generate the action in the correct format. Start by reasoning about the current situation. End with \"In summary, the next action I will perform is\" phrase, followed by action inside ``````. For example, \"Let's think step-by-step. Given the current state, I need to click on the like button which has id 1234. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```click [1234]```\".\n6. Issue stop action when you think you have achieved the objective. Don't generate anything after stop. \n\nHere are some example outputs for some random tasks:\n1. Let's think step-by-step. This page list the information of HP Inkjet Fax Machine, which is the product identified in the objective. Its price is $279.49. I think I have achieved the objective. I will issue the stop action with the answer. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```stop [$279.49]```\n2. Let's think step-by-step. This page has a search box whose ID is [164]. According to the nominatim rule of openstreetmap, I can search for the restaurants near a location by \"restaurants near\". I can submit my typing by pressing the Enter afterwards. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```type [164] [restaurants near CMU] [1]```"

    "prompt": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\nYou are an autonomous intelligent agent tasked with navigating a web browser. You will be given web-based tasks. These tasks will be accomplished through the use of specific actions you can issue.\n\nHere's the information you'll have:\nThe user's objective: This is the task you're trying to complete.\nThe current web page's accessibility tree: This is a simplified representation of the webpage, providing key information.\nThe current web page's URL: This is the page you're currently navigating.\nThe open tabs: These are the tabs you have open.\nThe previous actions: These are all the action you have performed. It may be helpful to track your progress.\n\nThe actions you can perform fall into several categories:\n\nPage Operation Actions:\n`click [id]`: This action clicks on an element with a specific id on the webpage.\n`type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]`: Use this to type the content into the field with id. By default, the \"Enter\" key is pressed after typing unless press_enter_after is set to 0.\n`hover [id]`: Hover over an element with id.\n`press [key_comb]`:  Simulates the pressing of a key combination on the keyboard (e.g., Ctrl+v).\n`scroll [down|up]`: Scroll the page up or down.\n\nTab Management Actions:\n`new_tab`: Open a new, empty browser tab.\n`tab_focus [tab_index]`: Switch the browser's focus to a specific tab using its index.\n`close_tab`: Close the currently active tab.\n\nURL Navigation Actions:\n`goto [url]`: Navigate to a specific URL.\n`go_back`: Navigate to the previously viewed page.\n`go_forward`: Navigate to the next page (if a previous 'go_back' action was performed).\n\nCompletion Action:\n`stop [answer]`: Issue this action when you believe the task is complete. If the objective is to find a text-based answer, provide the answer in the bracket. If you believe the task is impossible to complete, provide the answer as \"N/A\" in the bracket.\n\nHomepage:\nIf you want to visit other websites, check out the homepage at http://homepage.com. It has a list of websites you can visit.\n\nTo be successful, it is very important to follow the following rules:\n1. You should only issue an action that is valid given the current observation\n2. You should only issue one action at a time.\n3. You should follow the examples to reason step by step and then issue the next action.\n4. You are strictly forbidden from issuing a goto action to a URL that is not on the homepage.\n5. Generate the action in the correct format. Start by reasoning about the current situation. End with \"In summary, the next action I will perform is\" phrase, followed by action inside ``````. For example, \"Let's think step-by-step. Given the current state, I need to click on the like button which has id 1234. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```click [1234]```\".\n6. Issue stop action when you think you have achieved the objective. Don't generate anything after stop. \n\nHere are some example outputs for some random tasks:\n1. Let's think step-by-step. This page list the information of HP Inkjet Fax Machine, which is the product identified in the objective. Its price is $279.49. I think I have achieved the objective. I will issue the stop action with the answer. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```stop [$279.49]```\n2. Let's think step-by-step. This page has a search box whose ID is [164]. According to the nominatim rule of openstreetmap, I can search for the restaurants near a location by \"restaurants near\". I can submit my typing by pressing the Enter afterwards. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```type [164] [restaurants near CMU] [1]```\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\nOBSERVATION:\nTab 0 (current): Quest Lumaflex™ Band /

These tasks will be accomplished through the use of specific actions you can issue.\n\nHere's the information you'll have:\nThe user's objective: This is the task you're trying to complete.\nThe current web page's accessibility tree: This is a simplified representation of the webpage, providing key information.\nThe current web page's URL: This is the page you're currently navigating.\nThe open tabs: These are the tabs you have open.\nThe previous actions: These are all the action you have performed. It may be helpful to track your progress.\n\nThe actions you can perform fall into several categories:\n\nPage Operation Actions:\n`click [id]`: This action clicks on an element with a specific id on the webpage.\n`type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]`: Use this to type the content into the field with id. By default, the \"Enter\" key is pressed after typing unless press_enter_after is set to 0.\n`hover [id]`: Hover over an element with id.\n`press [key_comb]`:  Simulates the pressing of a key combination on the keyboard (e.g., Ctrl+v).\n`scroll [down|up]`: Scroll the page up or down.\n\nTab Management Actions:\n`new_tab`: Open a new, empty browser tab.\n`tab_focus [tab_index]`: Switch the browser's focus to a specific tab using its index.\n`close_tab`: Close the currently active tab.\n\nURL Navigation Actions:\n`goto [url]`: Navigate to a specific URL.\n`go_back`: Navigate to the previously viewed page.\n`go_forward`: Navigate to the next page (if a previous 'go_back' action was performed).\n\nCompletion Action:\n`stop [answer]`: Issue this action when you believe the task is complete.

If you believe the task is impossible to complete, provide the answer as \"N/A\" in the bracket.\n\nHomepage:\nIf you want to visit other websites, check out the homepage at http://homepage.com.

You should only issue one action at a time.\n3. You should follow the examples to reason step by step and then issue the next action.\n4. You are strictly forbidden from issuing a goto action to a URL that is not on the homepage.\n5. Generate the action in the correct format. Start by reasoning about the current situation. End with \"In summary, the next action I will perform is\" phrase, followed by action inside ``````. For example, \"Let's think step-by-step. Given the current state, I need to click on the like button which has id 1234. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```click [1234]```\".\n6.

This page list the information of HP Inkjet Fax Machine, which is the product identified in the objective. Its price is $279.49. I think I have achieved the objective.

    "prompt": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\nYou are an autonomous intelligent agent tasked with navigating a web browser. You will be given web-based tasks. These tasks will be accomplished through the use of specific actions you can issue.\n\nHere's the information you'll have:\nThe user's objective: This is the task you're trying to complete.\nThe current web page's accessibility tree: This is a simplified representation of the webpage, providing key information.\nThe current web page's URL: This is the page you're currently navigating.\nThe open tabs: These are the tabs you have open.\nThe previous actions: These are all the action you have performed. It may be helpful to track your progress.\n\nThe actions you can perform fall into several categories:\n\nPage Operation Actions:\n`click [id]`: This action clicks on an element with a specific id on the webpage.\n`type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]`: Use this to type the content into the field with id. By default, the \"Enter\" key is pressed after typing unless press_enter_after is set to 0.\n`hover [id]`: Hover over an element with id.\n`press [key_comb]`:  Simulates the pressing of a key combination on the keyboard (e.g., Ctrl+v).\n`scroll [down|up]`: Scroll the page up or down.\n\nTab Management Actions:\n`new_tab`: Open a new, empty browser tab.\n`tab_focus [tab_index]`: Switch the browser's focus to a specific tab using its index.\n`close_tab`: Close the currently active tab.\n\nURL Navigation Actions:\n`goto [url]`: Navigate to a specific URL.\n`go_back`: Navigate to the previously viewed page.\n`go_forward`: Navigate to the next page (if a previous 'go_back' action was performed).\n\nCompletion Action:\n`stop [answer]`: Issue this action when you believe the task is complete. If the objective is to find a text-based answer, provide the answer in the bracket. If you believe the task is impossible to complete, provide the answer as \"N/A\" in the bracket.\n\nHomepage:\nIf you want to visit other websites, check out the homepage at http://homepage.com. It has a list of websites you can visit.\n\nTo be successful, it is very important to follow the following rules:\n1. You should only issue an action that is valid given the current observation\n2. You should only issue one action at a time.\n3. You should follow the examples to reason step by step and then issue the next action.\n4. You are strictly forbidden from issuing a goto action to a URL that is not on the homepage.\n5. Generate the action in the correct format. Start by reasoning about the current situation. End with \"In summary, the next action I will perform is\" phrase, followed by action inside ``````. For example, \"Let's think step-by-step. Given the current state, I need to click on the like button which has id 1234. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```click [1234]```\".\n6. Issue stop action when you think you have achieved the objective. Don't generate anything after stop. \n\nHere are some example outputs for some random tasks:\n1. Let's think step-by-step. This page list the information of HP Inkjet Fax Machine, which is the product identified in the objective. Its price is $279.49. I think I have achieved the objective. I will issue the stop action with the answer. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```stop [$279.49]```\n2. Let's think step-by-step. This page has a search box whose ID is [164]. According to the nominatim rule of openstreetmap, I can search for the restaurants near a location by \"restaurants near\". I can submit my typing by pressing the Enter afterwards. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```type [164] [restaurants near CMU] [1]```\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\nOBSERVATION:\nTab 0 (current): 40.4445,-79.944restaurants near 40.4445,-79.94477 | OpenStreetMap\n\n[1] RootWebArea '40.4445,-79.944restaurants near 40.4445,-79.94477 | OpenStreetMap' focused: True\n\t[36] heading 'OpenStreetMap logo OpenStreetMap'\n\t\t[41] link 'OpenStreetMap logo OpenStreetMap'\n\t\t\t[44] img 'OpenStreetMap logo'\n\t[381] link 'Edit'\n\t[382] button ''\n\t[352] link 'History'\n\t[353] link 'Export'\n\t[386] link 'GPS Traces'\n\t[387] link 'User Diaries'\n\t[388] link 'Communities'\n\t[389] link 'Copyright'\n\t[390] link 'Help'\n\t[391] link 'About'\n\t[361] link 'Log In'\n\t[362] link 'Sign Up'\n\t[1016] button 'Close'\n\t[1020] textbox 'From' required: False\n\t\t[1041] StaticText '40.44419, -79.94272'\n\t[975] textbox 'To' required: False\n\t[1027] combobox '' hasPopup: menu expanded: False\n\t\t[1029] menuitem 'Bicycle (OSRM)' selected: False\n\t\t[1030] menuitem 'Car (OSRM)' selected: True\n\t\t[1031] menuitem 'Foot (OSRM)' selected: False\n\t[1032] button 'Go'\n\t[972] button 'Reverse Directions'\n\t[1007] heading 'Directions'\n\t[1010] button 'Close'\n\t[1011] StaticText 'Distance: 0m.
