Let's reevaluate the problem.\n\nTo staff the battle station, Zarnin needs to select one candidate for each of the four job openings from the pool of 12 resumes. Since a candidate can fill at most one job opening, this can be seen as a permutation problem.\n\nThe number of ways to select one candidate for the first job opening is 12. After selecting a candidate for the first job opening, there are 11 candidates remaining for the second job opening. Similarly, there are 10 candidates remaining for the third job opening and 9 candidates remaining for the fourth job opening.\n\nTherefore, the total number of ways to staff the battle station is:\n\n12 * 11 * 10 * 9 = 11,880\n\nThe answer is <solution> 11,880 </solution>.",
