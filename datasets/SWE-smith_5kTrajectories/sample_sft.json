        "value": "I've implemented a factorial function for you using recursion. The factorial of a number n (denoted as n!) is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n.\n\nHere's how the function works:\n1. It checks if n is 0 or 1, in which case it returns 1 (since 0! = 1 and 1! = 1 by definition)\n2. Otherwise, it multiplies n by the factorial of (n-1)\n\nI tested the function with factorial(5), which correctly returned 120:\n5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120\n\nThis implementation is simple and works well for small numbers. However, be aware that for large numbers, you might encounter a RecursionError due to Python's recursion limit. For larger numbers, you might want to use an iterative approach instead."
