Participants were recruited from seven before-and-after-school childcare programs throughout the city of Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. The wellbeing of children at school was influenced by the quality of the relationships they had with their teachers. Children recognized teachers as being essential agents in their learning process and teaching them essential skills for their future. Children who described feeling positive about school were children who felt that their teachers were supportive, provided creative ways to learn, and listened to their ideas and concerns. Conversely, children who described negative feelings about school discussed experiencing teachers who did not value their ideas and concerns, and were not supportive in their individual needs as a learner. The teaching style of teachers affect children's wellbeing at school. Teachers who promote wellbeing at school and positive feeling associated with learning are those who consider the voices and needs of their students, as well as make efforts to incorporate those considerations in their curriculum.\"\n\t[1117] FooterAsNonLandmark ''\n\t\t[4364] link 'View'\n\t\t[4365] button 'Show abstract'\n\t[1161] StaticText '...

Analyses were based on a large sample of 9881 students in 614 classes in the final grade of primary education. The results indicated that teacher expectations – as measured by track recommendations - and the teacher-student relationship were not consistent in antecedents. Student performance, parental education, and closeness were positive predictors of track recommendations, whereas they were negatively associated with conflict and dependency. Ethnicity was positively associated with track recommendations, but negatively with closeness. Furthermore, perceived closeness and conflict were not statistically significantly associated with track recommendations. A negative association was found for perceived dependency with teachers’ track recommendations, although the latter association appeared stronger for high performing students.
