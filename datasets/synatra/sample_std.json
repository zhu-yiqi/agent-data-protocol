Participants were recruited from seven before-and-after-school childcare programs throughout the city of Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. The wellbeing of children at school was influenced by the quality of the relationships they had with their teachers. Children recognized teachers as being essential agents in their learning process and teaching them essential skills for their future. Children who described feeling positive about school were children who felt that their teachers were supportive, provided creative ways to learn, and listened to their ideas and concerns. Conversely, children who described negative feelings about school discussed experiencing teachers who did not value their ideas and concerns, and were not supportive in their individual needs as a learner. The teaching style of teachers affect children's wellbeing at school. Teachers who promote wellbeing at school and positive feeling associated with learning are those who consider the voices and needs of their students, as well as make efforts to incorporate those considerations in their curriculum.\"\n\t[1117] FooterAsNonLandmark ''\n\t\t[4364] link 'View'\n\t\t[4365] button 'Show abstract'\n\t[1161] StaticText '...

This offers support to the construct validity of operationalization of gifted teachers as those competently demonstrating consensually agreed upon indicators of quality at a high level, across different focus areas of educational practice. The results were interpreted in accordance with the contemporary, empirically proven influence of teachers on students' learning and the outcomes of this learning.
