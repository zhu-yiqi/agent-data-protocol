# nebius/SWE-agent-trajectories

The [nebius/SWE-agent-trajectories](https://huggingface.co/datasets/nebius/SWE-agent-trajectories) dataset contains 80,036 trajectories generated by a software engineering agent based on the SWE-agent framework, using various models as action generators. In these trajectories, the agent attempts to solve GitHub issues from the [nebius/SWE-bench-extra](https://huggingface.co/datasets/nebius/SWE-bench-extra) and the dev split of [princeton-nlp/SWE-bench](https://huggingface.co/datasets/princeton-nlp/SWE-bench).
