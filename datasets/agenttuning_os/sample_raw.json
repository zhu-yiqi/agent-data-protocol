If you think you should execute some bash code, take bash action, and you should print like this:\n\nThink: put your thought here.\n\nAct: bash\n\n```bash\n# put your bash code here\n```\n\n2. If you think you have finished the task, take finish action, and you should print like this:\n\nThink: put your thought here.\n\nAct: finish\n\n3.
