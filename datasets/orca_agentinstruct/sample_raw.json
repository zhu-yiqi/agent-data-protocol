        "content": "Output:\n\nIn the given scenario, the `find_path` command is used to search for the `mylib.h` header file. Since `mylib.h` is not found, `MYLIB_INCLUDE_DIRS` will not be set, and this will be a critical failure for the `find_package_handle_standard_args` function, which expects `MYLIB_INCLUDE_DIRS` to be set to a valid path.\n\nThe `find_library` command is used to locate the `mylib` library and its extra component. The library names are determined based on the platform. For Windows, it looks for `mylib_win`, for Unix-like systems, it looks for `mylib_unix` or `mylib_unix_alt`, and for other platforms, it defaults to `mylib`. Since the libraries are found in non-standard locations, `MYLIB_LIBRARIES` and `MYLIB_EXTRA_LIBRARIES` will be set to those locations.\n\nThe `find_package_handle_standard_args` function is called to handle the results of the find commands. It checks if the required variables (`MYLIB_LIBRARIES`, `MYLIB_INCLUDE_DIRS`, `MYLIB_EXTRA_LIBRARIES`) are set. If any of these are not found, it will print a standard error message, and `MYLIB_FOUND` will not be set to `TRUE`.\n\nAfter the find commands, the `check_mylib_version` function is called to check the version of the library. Since the version found is 2.1, which is not less than 2.0, `MYLIB_VERSION_OK` will be set to `TRUE`.\n\nHowever, despite the library and its extra component being found and the version being acceptable, `MYLIB_FOUND` will not be set to `TRUE` because `MYLIB_INCLUDE_DIRS` is not set (the header file was not found). The `MYLIB_FOUND` variable is only set to `TRUE` if all components (include directories, libraries, extra libraries) are found and the version is okay.\n\nThe version checking logic is important because it ensures that the library version meets the minimum requirements for compatibility with the project. If the version is too old, it may lack necessary features or bug fixes, and the `MYLIB_VERSION_OK` variable will be set to `FALSE`, which would prevent `MYLIB_FOUND` from being set to `TRUE`.\n\nHandling different library names based on the platform is crucial because libraries can have different naming conventions on different operating systems. This flexibility allows the CMake script to find the correct library files regardless of the platform it is running on.\n\nFinding all components of the library is important because a library typically consists of both binary files (the library itself) and header files (for including in the source code). If any component is missing, the library cannot be fully utilized, and the build process may fail. Therefore, it is essential to ensure that all parts of the library are present before proceeding with the build."

In this case, it is used to describe the size of the `WordVectors` and `WordClusters` objects.\n- The output format \"WordVectors size: (1000000, 300)\" suggests that the `size` function was called on a `WordVectors` object, returning a tuple representing the number of words in the vocabulary (1,000,000) and the number of dimensions of the vectors (300).\n- Similarly, the output \"WordClusters size: (1000000, 50)\" suggests that the `size` function was called on a `WordClusters` object, returning a tuple representing the number of words in the vocabulary (1,000,000) and the number of dimensions of the clusters (50).\n\nTherefore, the original inputs were objects of types `WordVectors` and `WordClusters` with the specified dimensions."

A `data-theme` attribute selector is used to switch colors for dark mode.\n3. **Responsive Design**: A mixin named `respond-to` is created to handle media queries for different breakpoints (phone, tablet, desktop).\n4. **CSS Animations**: Keyframes are defined using a mixin for cross-browser compatibility. Animations are applied to buttons and links to improve user engagement.\n5. **Cross-Browser Compatibility**: Vendor prefixes are included in the keyframes mixin to ensure animations work across different browsers.\n6. **Performance Optimization**: By using variables and mixins, redundant code is reduced. Also, the use of `@content` inside mixins allows for writing media queries and animations only once, and then including them as needed, which keeps the code DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself).\n\nTo implement the dark mode toggle feature, you would need to add a small JavaScript snippet to toggle the `data-theme` attribute on the root element:\n\n```javascript\nconst toggleButton = document.querySelector('.dark-mode-toggle');\ntoggleButton.addEventListener('click', () => {\n  const theme = document.documentElement.getAttribute('data-theme') === 'dark' ? 'light' : 'dark';\n  document.documentElement.setAttribute('data-theme', theme);\n});\n```\n\nThis JavaScript code listens for clicks on the `.dark-mode-toggle` button and toggles the `data-theme` attribute between 'light' and 'dark', which in turn switches the color scheme based on the CSS variables defined for each theme."
