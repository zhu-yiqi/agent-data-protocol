        "value": "<function=finish>\n<parameter=message>\nIntegrating geothermal heating and cooling systems into new building projects on a limited budget requires careful planning, design, and consideration of various factors to ensure cost-effectiveness and sustainability without compromising quality and performance. Here are some strategies to achieve this:\n\n1. **Early Integration in Design Phase**: Incorporate geothermal systems into the building design from the outset. Early integration allows for optimization of the system and building design, potentially reducing costs associated with retrofitting or modifying existing plans.\n\n2. **Site Analysis**: Conduct a thorough site analysis to understand the geothermal potential of the location. Factors such as soil composition, groundwater availability, and local geology can significantly impact the efficiency and initial costs of the system.\n\n3. **System Sizing and Design**: Work with experienced geothermal designers to size the system appropriately. Oversizing can lead to unnecessary costs, while undersizing can compromise performance. A well-designed system tailored to the building's specific heating and cooling needs can be more cost-effective in the long run.\n\n4. **Incorporate Passive Design Principles**: Maximize the use of passive solar design, insulation, and natural ventilation to reduce the overall load on the geothermal system. This can lead to a smaller and less expensive system.\n\n5. **Utilize Incentives and Rebates**: Research and apply for any available government incentives, rebates, or tax credits for renewable energy installations. These can significantly offset the initial investment costs.\n\n6. **Cost Sharing**: If the building is part of a larger development, consider shared geothermal resources. Multiple buildings can tap into a single geothermal field, distributing the installation and maintenance costs across several stakeholders.\n\n7. **Hybrid Systems**: In some cases, a hybrid system that combines geothermal with other renewable energy sources or traditional HVAC systems can be more cost-effective while still providing sustainability benefits.\n\n8. **Modular and Scalable Design**: Design the geothermal system to be modular and scalable, allowing for expansion or adjustments as budgets permit or as the building's energy demands change over time.\n\n9. **Energy Modeling**: Use energy modeling software to simulate the building's energy performance with the geothermal system. This can help in optimizing the design and predicting the return on investment.\n\n10. **Efficient Equipment**: Invest in high-quality, energy-efficient pumps and heat exchangers that have a higher upfront cost but lower operating costs and longer lifespans.\n\n11. **Training and Maintenance**: Ensure that the building maintenance staff is trained in the operation and upkeep of the geothermal system. Proper maintenance can extend the life of the system and ensure it operates at peak efficiency.\n\n12. **Financing Options**: Explore various financing options such as green bonds, energy-saving performance contracts, or power purchase agreements that can alleviate the upfront costs and spread payments over the life of the system.\n\n13. **Integrate with Building Aesthetics**: Work with architects to ensure that the geothermal system components, such as the ground loop fields, are integrated into the landscape design in an aesthetically pleasing way that does not detract from the building's appearance.\n\nBy considering these strategies, geothermal heating and cooling systems can be integrated into new building projects in a cost-effective manner, enhancing sustainability and maintaining high-quality performance. It's important to work with professionals who have experience in geothermal systems to ensure the most efficient and effective design.\n</parameter>\n<parameter=task_completed>\ntrue\n</parameter>\n</function>"

If `path` is a directory, `view` lists non-hidden files and directories up to 2 levels deep\n* The `create` command cannot be used if the specified `path` already exists as a file\n* If a `command` generates a long output, it will be truncated and marked with `<response clipped>`\n* The `undo_edit` command will revert the last edit made to the file at `path`\n\n\nBefore using this tool:\n1. Use the view tool to understand the file's contents and context\n2. Verify the directory path is correct (only applicable when creating new files):\n   - Use the view tool to verify the parent directory exists and is the correct location\n\nWhen making edits:\n   - Ensure the edit results in idiomatic, correct code\n   - Do not leave the code in a broken state\n   - Always use absolute file paths (starting with /)\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS FOR USING THIS TOOL:\n\n1. EXACT MATCHING: The `old_str` parameter must match EXACTLY one or more consecutive lines from the file, including all whitespace and indentation. The tool will fail if `old_str` matches multiple locations or doesn't match exactly with the file content.\n\n2. UNIQUENESS: The `old_str` must uniquely identify a single instance in the file:\n   - Include sufficient context before and after the change point (3-5 lines recommended)\n   - If not unique, the replacement will not be performed\n\n3. REPLACEMENT: The `new_str` parameter should contain the edited lines that replace the `old_str`. Both strings must be different.\n\nRemember: when making multiple file edits in a row to the same file, you should prefer to send all edits in a single message with multiple calls to this tool, rather than multiple messages with a single call each.\n\nParameters:\n  (1) command (string, required): The commands to run. Allowed options are: `view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`.\nAllowed values: [`view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`]\n  (2) path (string, required): Absolute path to file or directory, e.g. `/workspace/file.py` or `/workspace`.\n  (3) file_text (string, optional): Required parameter of `create` command, with the content of the file to be created.\n  (4) old_str (string, optional): Required parameter of `str_replace` command containing the string in `path` to replace.\n  (5) new_str (string, optional): Optional parameter of `str_replace` command containing the new string (if not given, no string will be added). Required parameter of `insert` command containing the string to insert.\n  (6) insert_line (integer, optional): Required parameter of `insert` command. The `new_str` will be inserted AFTER the line `insert_line` of `path`.\n  (7) view_range (array, optional): Optional parameter of `view` command when `path` points to a file. If none is given, the full file is shown. If provided, the file will be shown in the indicated line number range, e.g. [11, 12] will show lines 11 and 12. Indexing at 1 to start. Setting `[start_line, -1]` shows all lines from `start_line` to the end of the file.\n---- END FUNCTION #7 ----\n\n\nIf you choose to call a function ONLY reply in the following format with NO suffix:\n\n<function=example_function_name>\n<parameter=example_parameter_1>value_1</parameter>\n<parameter=example_parameter_2>\nThis is the value for the second parameter\nthat can span\nmultiple lines\n</parameter>\n</function>\n\n<IMPORTANT>\nReminder:\n- Function calls MUST follow the specified format, start with <function= and end with </function>\n- Required parameters MUST be specified\n- Only call one function at a time\n- You may provide optional reasoning for your function call in natural language BEFORE the function call, but NOT after.\n- If there is no function call available, answer the question like normal with your current knowledge and do not tell the user about function calls\n</IMPORTANT>\n"

Venter, meanwhile, came off against Glasgow Warriors this past weekend in the 16th minute after a heavy tackle which saw him struggle to find his balance. The same protocol will be observed, no doubt, for wing Rabz Maxwane who also suffered a nasty concussion in the seventh minute of the encounter.\r\nSaid Redelinghuys of those injuries on Wednesday: \u201cThe effects of losing quality players like that is felt but what is exciting to see are the guys stepping in and then taking over and putting up their hands.\r\n\u201cNo rugby player stays on the field forever and no player stays off the field forever. It is good to see if you lose a quality player like Ruan or Manu, whoever steps into his spot, he slots in well and he does the job for you as well.\u201d\r\nThe loss of the bruising Venter, therefore, could be an opportunity for Sibusiso Sangweni or Ruhan Straeuli to be elevated to the United Rugby Championship (URC) team this weekend after playing in the Currie Cup, with either Ruan Delport or Travis Gordon \u2013 both on the bench against the Warriors this past weekend \u2013 possibly selected into the starting XV in his absence.\r\nThe backline will in all probability have to be rejigged as well, with Adries Coetzee possibly returning to the starting XV at fullback and Quan Horn moving onto the wing to cover for Maxwane.\r\nThe Lions will not face the full might of table-topping Leinster on matchday. Even so, the Irish franchise remains a frightening proposition to face, such is their stability, focus, intent and depth. It is a fact that Redelinghuys admitted will have to be overcome, if they are to hand the visitors their first defeat of the campaign.\r\n\u201c (Leinster) are No 1 on the log, and they have played with this team several times,\" he said.\r\n\u201cIt is a good set-up they have in Leinster and this is a very good team, but we are not looking much into it ... This week for us is about putting in the details \u2013 getting the little things right to get us closer to where we want to be.\u201d\r\nThe Lions kick-off against Leinster at 4pm at Emirates Airline Park on Saturday.

Just give an answer to the question.\n</ROLE>\n\n<EFFICIENCY>\n* Each action you take is somewhat expensive. Wherever possible, combine multiple actions into a single action, e.g. combine multiple bash commands into one, using sed and grep to edit/view multiple files at once.\n* When exploring the codebase, use efficient tools like find, grep, and git commands with appropriate filters to minimize unnecessary operations.\n</EFFICIENCY>\n\n<FILE_SYSTEM_GUIDELINES>\n* When a user provides a file path, do NOT assume it's relative to the current working directory. First explore the file system to locate the file before working on it.\n* If asked to edit a file, edit the file directly, rather than creating a new file with a different filename.\n* For global search-and-replace operations, consider using `sed` instead of opening file editors multiple times.\n</FILE_SYSTEM_GUIDELINES>\n\n<CODE_QUALITY>\n* Write clean, efficient code with minimal comments. Avoid redundancy in comments: Do not repeat information that can be easily inferred from the code itself.\n* When implementing solutions, focus on making the minimal changes needed to solve the problem.\n* Before implementing any changes, first thoroughly understand the codebase through exploration.\n* If you are adding a lot of code to a function or file, consider splitting the function or file into smaller pieces when appropriate.\n</CODE_QUALITY>\n\n<VERSION_CONTROL>\n* When configuring git credentials, use \"openhands\" as the user.name and \"openhands@all-hands.dev\" as the user.email by default, unless explicitly instructed otherwise.\n* Exercise caution with git operations. Do NOT make potentially dangerous changes (e.g., pushing to main, deleting repositories) unless explicitly asked to do so.\n* When committing changes, use `git status` to see all modified files, and stage all files necessary for the commit.

If `path` is a directory, `view` lists non-hidden files and directories up to 2 levels deep\n* The `create` command cannot be used if the specified `path` already exists as a file\n* If a `command` generates a long output, it will be truncated and marked with `<response clipped>`\n* The `undo_edit` command will revert the last edit made to the file at `path`\n\n\nBefore using this tool:\n1. Use the view tool to understand the file's contents and context\n2. Verify the directory path is correct (only applicable when creating new files):\n   - Use the view tool to verify the parent directory exists and is the correct location\n\nWhen making edits:\n   - Ensure the edit results in idiomatic, correct code\n   - Do not leave the code in a broken state\n   - Always use absolute file paths (starting with /)\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS FOR USING THIS TOOL:\n\n1. EXACT MATCHING: The `old_str` parameter must match EXACTLY one or more consecutive lines from the file, including all whitespace and indentation. The tool will fail if `old_str` matches multiple locations or doesn't match exactly with the file content.\n\n2. UNIQUENESS: The `old_str` must uniquely identify a single instance in the file:\n   - Include sufficient context before and after the change point (3-5 lines recommended)\n   - If not unique, the replacement will not be performed\n\n3. REPLACEMENT: The `new_str` parameter should contain the edited lines that replace the `old_str`. Both strings must be different.\n\nRemember: when making multiple file edits in a row to the same file, you should prefer to send all edits in a single message with multiple calls to this tool, rather than multiple messages with a single call each.\n\nParameters:\n  (1) command (string, required): The commands to run. Allowed options are: `view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`.\nAllowed values: [`view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`]\n  (2) path (string, required): Absolute path to file or directory, e.g. `/workspace/file.py` or `/workspace`.\n  (3) file_text (string, optional): Required parameter of `create` command, with the content of the file to be created.\n  (4) old_str (string, optional): Required parameter of `str_replace` command containing the string in `path` to replace.\n  (5) new_str (string, optional): Optional parameter of `str_replace` command containing the new string (if not given, no string will be added). Required parameter of `insert` command containing the string to insert.\n  (6) insert_line (integer, optional): Required parameter of `insert` command. The `new_str` will be inserted AFTER the line `insert_line` of `path`.\n  (7) view_range (array, optional): Optional parameter of `view` command when `path` points to a file. If none is given, the full file is shown. If provided, the file will be shown in the indicated line number range, e.g. [11, 12] will show lines 11 and 12. Indexing at 1 to start. Setting `[start_line, -1]` shows all lines from `start_line` to the end of the file.\n---- END FUNCTION #7 ----\n\n\nIf you choose to call a function ONLY reply in the following format with NO suffix:\n\n<function=example_function_name>\n<parameter=example_parameter_1>value_1</parameter>\n<parameter=example_parameter_2>\nThis is the value for the second parameter\nthat can span\nmultiple lines\n</parameter>\n</function>\n\n<IMPORTANT>\nReminder:\n- Function calls MUST follow the specified format, start with <function= and end with </function>\n- Required parameters MUST be specified\n- Only call one function at a time\n- You may provide optional reasoning for your function call in natural language BEFORE the function call, but NOT after.\n- If there is no function call available, answer the question like normal with your current knowledge and do not tell the user about function calls\n</IMPORTANT>\n"

Supports magic commands like %pip.\n---- END FUNCTION #6 ----\n\n---- BEGIN FUNCTION #7: str_replace_editor ----\nDescription: Custom editing tool for viewing, creating and editing files in plain-text format\n* State is persistent across command calls and discussions with the user\n* If `path` is a file, `view` displays the result of applying `cat -n`. If `path` is a directory, `view` lists non-hidden files and directories up to 2 levels deep\n* The `create` command cannot be used if the specified `path` already exists as a file\n* If a `command` generates a long output, it will be truncated and marked with `<response clipped>`\n* The `undo_edit` command will revert the last edit made to the file at `path`\n\n\nBefore using this tool:\n1. Use the view tool to understand the file's contents and context\n2. Verify the directory path is correct (only applicable when creating new files):\n   - Use the view tool to verify the parent directory exists and is the correct location\n\nWhen making edits:\n   - Ensure the edit results in idiomatic, correct code\n   - Do not leave the code in a broken state\n   - Always use absolute file paths (starting with /)\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS FOR USING THIS TOOL:\n\n1. EXACT MATCHING: The `old_str` parameter must match EXACTLY one or more consecutive lines from the file, including all whitespace and indentation. The tool will fail if `old_str` matches multiple locations or doesn't match exactly with the file content.\n\n2. UNIQUENESS: The `old_str` must uniquely identify a single instance in the file:\n   - Include sufficient context before and after the change point (3-5 lines recommended)\n   - If not unique, the replacement will not be performed\n\n3. REPLACEMENT: The `new_str` parameter should contain the edited lines that replace the `old_str`. Both strings must be different.\n\nRemember: when making multiple file edits in a row to the same file, you should prefer to send all edits in a single message with multiple calls to this tool, rather than multiple messages with a single call each.\n\nParameters:\n  (1) command (string, required): The commands to run. Allowed options are: `view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`.\nAllowed values: [`view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`]\n  (2) path (string, required): Absolute path to file or directory, e.g. `/workspace/file.py` or `/workspace`.\n  (3) file_text (string, optional): Required parameter of `create` command, with the content of the file to be created.\n  (4) old_str (string, optional): Required parameter of `str_replace` command containing the string in `path` to replace.\n  (5) new_str (string, optional): Optional parameter of `str_replace` command containing the new string (if not given, no string will be added). Required parameter of `insert` command containing the string to insert.\n  (6) insert_line (integer, optional): Required parameter of `insert` command. The `new_str` will be inserted AFTER the line `insert_line` of `path`.\n  (7) view_range (array, optional): Optional parameter of `view` command when `path` points to a file. If none is given, the full file is shown. If provided, the file will be shown in the indicated line number range, e.g. [11, 12] will show lines 11 and 12. Indexing at 1 to start. Setting `[start_line, -1]` shows all lines from `start_line` to the end of the file.\n---- END FUNCTION #7 ----\n\n\nIf you choose to call a function ONLY reply in the following format with NO suffix:\n\n<function=example_function_name>\n<parameter=example_parameter_1>value_1</parameter>\n<parameter=example_parameter_2>\nThis is the value for the second parameter\nthat can span\nmultiple lines\n</parameter>\n</function>\n\n<IMPORTANT>\nReminder:\n- Function calls MUST follow the specified format, start with <function= and end with </function>\n- Required parameters MUST be specified\n- Only call one function at a time\n- You may provide optional reasoning for your function call in natural language BEFORE the function call, but NOT after.\n- If there is no function call available, answer the question like normal with your current knowledge and do not tell the user about function calls\n</IMPORTANT>\n"

        "from": "gpt",
        "value": "PCA is a widely used method for dimensionality reduction, but it is not always the best method for every scenario. The appropriateness of PCA or other methods depends on the specific characteristics of the data and the goals of the analysis. Here are some scenarios where other methods might be more appropriate:\n\n1. **Non-linear Relationships**: PCA is a linear method, which means it works best when the data has linear relationships. If the data has complex, non-linear relationships, other methods like t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) or Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) might be more effective.\n\n2. **Classification Tasks**: For classification tasks, Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) might be more appropriate because it seeks to reduce dimensions while preserving as much class discriminatory information as possible.\n\n3. **Sparse Data**: For data that is sparse (i.e., most of the elements are zero), methods like Truncated Singular Value Decomposition (Truncated SVD) are more suitable as they are designed to handle sparse matrices efficiently.\n\n4. **Large-scale Data**: For very large datasets, Incremental PCA or Randomized PCA might be more appropriate as they can handle large amounts of data without requiring the entire dataset to fit into memory.\n\n5. **Preserving Local Structure**: If preserving the local structure of the data is important, methods like Isomap or Locally Linear Embedding (LLE) might be more suitable as they focus on maintaining local distances between points.\n\n6. **Interpretable Features**: If interpretability of the features is important, methods like Factor Analysis or Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) might be preferred as they can provide more interpretable components.\n\n7. **Data with Outliers**: PCA can be sensitive to outliers in the data. Robust PCA or methods that are less sensitive to outliers might be more appropriate in such cases.\n\n8. **Domain-Specific Requirements**: In some domains, there might be specific requirements for dimensionality reduction that are better met by specialized methods. For example, in bioinformatics, methods that take into account the biological structure of the data might be preferred.\n\nIn summary, while PCA is a powerful and versatile technique, it is important to consider the nature of the dataset and the specific requirements of the task at hand when choosing a dimensionality reduction method."

        "value": "Yes, that's correct. Here's a concise summary:\n\n- **PCA (Principal Components Analysis)**: Best for reducing dimensions in datasets with linear relationships. It projects the data onto a lower-dimensional subspace while maximizing variance.\n\n- **t-SNE (t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding)**: Effective for visualizing high-dimensional data in two or three dimensions. It's particularly good at preserving local structures and revealing clusters in the data, making it suitable for non-linear relationships.\n\n- **UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection)**: Similar to t-SNE in that it's useful for visualization and preserving local structure, but it tends to be faster and can work with larger datasets. It also preserves more of the global structure than t-SNE.\n\n- **Incremental PCA**: A variant of PCA that is useful for large datasets that cannot fit in memory. It processes the data in mini-batches, making it scalable to large-scale problems.\n\n- **LLE (Locally Linear Embedding)**: A method that is particularly good at unfolding twisted or curved manifolds. It's a non-linear technique that preserves local neighborhood relationships.\n\nEach of these methods has its own strengths and is suited to particular types of data and analysis goals. It's important to choose the method that aligns best with the specific characteristics of your dataset and the insights you're looking to extract."

However, I can provide insights based on the current trends and research in the field of dimensionality reduction.\n\nOne of the most intriguing and promising dimensionality reduction techniques for future applications is **Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP)**. UMAP has gained popularity due to its ability to efficiently handle large datasets while preserving both the local and global structure of the data. It is also relatively fast and can be applied to a wide range of data types, including tabular data, images, and text.\n\nUMAP's flexibility allows it to be used not only for visualization but also as a preprocessing step for machine learning models, which can benefit from the reduced dimensionality of the input data. Additionally, UMAP has been extended to support supervised and semi-supervised learning, making it even more versatile.\n\nAnother promising area is the development of **deep learning-based dimensionality reduction techniques**. Autoencoders, for example, use neural networks to learn compressed representations of data in an unsupervised manner. Variants such as variational autoencoders (VAEs) and generative adversarial networks (GANs) can also be used for dimensionality reduction and have the added benefit of being able to generate new data samples.\n\nThe integration of dimensionality reduction techniques with deep learning is particularly promising for complex data types, such as high-resolution images, videos, and complex sensor data, where traditional methods might struggle to capture the underlying patterns.\n\nIn summary, while UMAP is currently seen as a highly promising technique for a variety of applications, the ongoing development of deep learning-based approaches is also an exciting area to watch for future advancements in dimensionality reduction."

Relative file paths are resolved relative to the current working directory. An empty list clears the selected files.\n    Examples:\n        upload_file('572', '/home/user/my_receipt.pdf')\n\n        upload_file('63', ['/home/bob/Documents/image.jpg', '/home/bob/Documents/file.zip'])\n\n---- END FUNCTION #5 ----\n\n---- BEGIN FUNCTION #6: execute_ipython_cell ----\nDescription: Run a cell of Python code in an IPython environment.\n* The assistant should define variables and import packages before using them.\n* The variable defined in the IPython environment will not be available outside the IPython environment (e.g., in terminal).\n\nParameters:\n  (1) code (string, required): The Python code to execute. Supports magic commands like %pip.\n---- END FUNCTION #6 ----\n\n---- BEGIN FUNCTION #7: str_replace_editor ----\nDescription: Custom editing tool for viewing, creating and editing files in plain-text format\n* State is persistent across command calls and discussions with the user\n* If `path` is a file, `view` displays the result of applying `cat -n`. If `path` is a directory, `view` lists non-hidden files and directories up to 2 levels deep\n* The `create` command cannot be used if the specified `path` already exists as a file\n* If a `command` generates a long output, it will be truncated and marked with `<response clipped>`\n* The `undo_edit` command will revert the last edit made to the file at `path`\n\n\nBefore using this tool:\n1. Use the view tool to understand the file's contents and context\n2. Verify the directory path is correct (only applicable when creating new files):\n   - Use the view tool to verify the parent directory exists and is the correct location\n\nWhen making edits:\n   - Ensure the edit results in idiomatic, correct code\n   - Do not leave the code in a broken state\n   - Always use absolute file paths (starting with /)\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS FOR USING THIS TOOL:\n\n1. EXACT MATCHING: The `old_str` parameter must match EXACTLY one or more consecutive lines from the file, including all whitespace and indentation. The tool will fail if `old_str` matches multiple locations or doesn't match exactly with the file content.\n\n2. UNIQUENESS: The `old_str` must uniquely identify a single instance in the file:\n   - Include sufficient context before and after the change point (3-5 lines recommended)\n   - If not unique, the replacement will not be performed\n\n3. REPLACEMENT: The `new_str` parameter should contain the edited lines that replace the `old_str`. Both strings must be different.\n\nRemember: when making multiple file edits in a row to the same file, you should prefer to send all edits in a single message with multiple calls to this tool, rather than multiple messages with a single call each.\n\nParameters:\n  (1) command (string, required): The commands to run. Allowed options are: `view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`.\nAllowed values: [`view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`]\n  (2) path (string, required): Absolute path to file or directory, e.g. `/workspace/file.py` or `/workspace`.\n  (3) file_text (string, optional): Required parameter of `create` command, with the content of the file to be created.\n  (4) old_str (string, optional): Required parameter of `str_replace` command containing the string in `path` to replace.\n  (5) new_str (string, optional): Optional parameter of `str_replace` command containing the new string (if not given, no string will be added). Required parameter of `insert` command containing the string to insert.\n  (6) insert_line (integer, optional): Required parameter of `insert` command. The `new_str` will be inserted AFTER the line `insert_line` of `path`.\n  (7) view_range (array, optional): Optional parameter of `view` command when `path` points to a file. If none is given, the full file is shown. If provided, the file will be shown in the indicated line number range, e.g. [11, 12] will show lines 11 and 12. Indexing at 1 to start. Setting `[start_line, -1]` shows all lines from `start_line` to the end of the file.\n---- END FUNCTION #7 ----\n\n\nIf you choose to call a function ONLY reply in the following format with NO suffix:\n\n<function=example_function_name>\n<parameter=example_parameter_1>value_1</parameter>\n<parameter=example_parameter_2>\nThis is the value for the second parameter\nthat can span\nmultiple lines\n</parameter>\n</function>\n\n<IMPORTANT>\nReminder:\n- Function calls MUST follow the specified format, start with <function= and end with </function>\n- Required parameters MUST be specified\n- Only call one function at a time\n- You may provide optional reasoning for your function call in natural language BEFORE the function call, but NOT after.\n- If there is no function call available, answer the question like normal with your current knowledge and do not tell the user about function calls\n</IMPORTANT>\n"
