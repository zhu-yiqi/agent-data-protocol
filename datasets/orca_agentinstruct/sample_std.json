Tagged with discuss, webdeveloper, javascript.\r\nUbaid Sid\r\nPosted on Aug 19, 2019\r\nHow to write a Frontend Web Developer Resume?\r\n# discuss # webdeveloper # javascript\r\nHey folks, I am going to apply for a job as front end web developer in a company for which resume is required. Do you have any advice on resume for entry level developer applying for first time?\r\n(14)\r\nThe first rule of resume - don't write every language/technology you've ever heard/studied about. Just don't.\r\nIt will show them that you wrote everything from some example resume and don't know any of them actually. Write only those things you know and you are interested in (if you can answer questions about them in the interview!). Remember that recruiter may ask you about anything that you wrote. If you know CSS but you will write that you know SCSS they can ask you about example mixins you created or what's the difference between them with examples. If you don't answer - well, most likely you won't get a job as you didn't tell truth in resume.\r\nOh, and don't write that you know Word/Excel/Paint, etc. You can basically recognise entry-level CVs thanks to that - I've seen it too many times.\r\nWrite a simple resume which will actually sum up your skills. I would rather hire a person (entry-level) with 3-4 skills in a CV that can be proven than with 15 skills and almost no proof. In \"about me\" section - if you are going to add it - you can add that you are interested in XYZ in your free time. It will show them you are interested and ambitious, you don't know this yet but there is potential :)\r\nI can totally recommend canva.com for writing resume. It's free and has PDF export. Templates are clear, simple and look professional.\r\nGood luck with that job \ud83e\udd1e\r\nI would like to double down on not putting every language/technology you've ever heard or studied about. To many times I would see someone who listed every language from Front-End to Back-End because they read about it once, then I would ask a simple question about CSS and they would not be able answer it. Like Natalia said if you can answer questions or at least be able to carry a conversation on about the language/technology then add it to your resume.\r\nAll around I wish I took this advice when I first started would have made interviews a lot easier going forward.\r\nBest of luck!\r\nI was going make this mistake of writing all skills and sub-skills in my resume. I thought that would make a good impression on my interviewer, but your point has made me avoid doing that.\r\nGlad we could help you :D Leave a note later if you got the job! :)\r\nI think Frontend Web Developer Resume is the same as any other Developer Resume.\r\nUsually, you divide resume into sections, here is an example used by me:\r\nContact data\r\nname\r\nemail\r\nphone number\r\nLinkedin/Github profile\r\nPersonal Profile (Write something about you. What you like about programming, hobbies ...)\r\nEducation (descendent order by time):\r\n2017-2019: Uni, Bachelor of Computer Science\r\n2015-2017: College, Computer Science\r\nExperience (descendent order by time):\r\nWeb app for Uni course: My team was aggregating a public gov API and my task was the website that displays external debt of Country in a friendly way. I created a small VueJS app with FLUX Architecture. | Link to Github repo\r\nChatbot: Using Facebook API I created a chatbot that message uni schedule, every evening and morning. I used NodeJS and ... | Link to Github repo\r\nmOcKiNgCaSe: npm package that converts a string to mOcKiNgCaSe. Contribution: Added \"onlyLetters\" option. | Link to Github repo\r\nSkills\r\nDevelopment: JavaScript/TypeScript (proficient), Version control/GIT (proficient), HTML/CSS (working knowledge), Python (basic knowledge)\r\nLanguages: Romanian (native), English (fluent), Russian (fluent), German (beginner)\r\nThanks Dragos. Is photo necessary on resume?\r\nNo, I would suggest to not attach the photo\r\nwhy?\r\nIf you have a good photo (taken by a photographer) that will make your CV look better then put it. Otherwise don't.\r\nKeep your known languages and libraries focused on the things you know.\r\nAsk yourself to explain the languages and libraries you know, you'll find any gaps you might have and what level of experience you have when it comes up.\r\nResearch on these gaps, you don't want to be stuck getting asked: \"Can you define OOP?\" without an answer.\r\nProofread for any typos or mistakes. Written and verbal communication is more important than people think as a developer, and this can give off a less than good first impression.\r\nRemember all the things you put down on your resume, sometimes it can be too easy to jot something down and forget about it. You don't want to get blind-sighted by your own resume.\r\nBonus Make a small, simple, nice looking portfolio site and leave a link on your resume. Especially as a front end developer, it's a nice addition that shows you know the basics o...(Truncated)\n\n\nElaborate on the benefits of using canva.com for resume creation.",

Each side of the plate can have different boundary conditions: maintained at a certain temperature, insulated, or exposed to an environment with a known convective heat transfer coefficient. Given the properties of the metal (thermal conductivity, density, specific heat), the thickness of the plate, and a specific grid spacing, calculate the steady-state temperature distribution across the plate using the finite difference method. Scenarios should include different shapes, sizes, boundary conditions, materials, and points of interest for temperature calculation.\n\nExample 1\n\nQ:\nA rectangular bronze plate with dimensions of 25 cm by 40 cm and a thickness of 3 mm is exposed to the following boundary conditions: the left side is insulated, the right side is maintained at 150\u00b0C, the top side is exposed to an environment with a convective heat transfer coefficient of 30 W/m\u00b2K and an ambient temperature of 25\u00b0C, and the bottom side is maintained at 75\u00b0C. The thermal conductivity of bronze is 116 W/mK, the density is 8800 kg/m\u00b3, and the specific heat is 377 J/kgK.

These puzzles should help students understand how to read clocks, calculate time intervals, and comprehend schedules and time zones.\n\nRequirements:\n1. Develop puzzles that involve reading analog and digital clocks to determine the time.\n2. Create scenarios where students must calculate the duration between two events or times.\n3. Include puzzles that require understanding and working with different time formats, such as 12-hour and 24-hour clocks.\n4. Design word problems that involve planning schedules, considering time zones, and calculating arrival or departure times.\n5. The puzzles should vary in complexity, introducing concepts such as daylight saving time, international time zones, and the calculation of time differences across cities or countries.\n\nProvide examples of each type of puzzle, along with a clear explanation of the thought process and solution.\n\nExample 1\nInput:\nA flight departs New York at 3:00 PM EST and arrives in Los Angeles at 6:00 PM PST. Considering the time zone difference, how long is the flight?\n\nOutput:\nTo calculate the flight duration, we must account for the time zone difference between New York (EST) and Los Angeles (PST), which is 3 hours, with New York being ahead. The flight departs at 3:00 PM EST; at that moment, it is 12:00 PM PST in Los Angeles. The flight arrives at 6:00 PM PST. To find the duration, we calculate the time from 12:00 PM to 6:00 PM, which is 6 hours. Therefore, the flight duration is 6 hours.\n\nExample 2\nInput:\nConvert 4:00 PM to 24-hour format and then determine what time it will be 5 hours later.\n\nOutput:\nTo convert the time from 12-hour to 24-hour format, we add 12 to the PM hours. Therefore, 4:00 PM becomes 16:00 in 24-hour format. To find out what time it will be 5 hours later, we add 5 to the hour part of the time: 16 + 5 = 21. Thus, the time 5 hours later is 21:00, which is equivalent to 9:00 PM in 12-hour format.\n\nExample 3\nInput:\nIf a movie starts at 7:45 PM and ends at 9:30 PM, how long is the movie?\n\nOutput:\nTo calculate the duration of the movie, we need to find the time difference between the start and end times. We start by finding the difference in hours: from 7:45 PM to 8:45 PM is one hour. Then, we calculate the remaining minutes from 8:45 PM to 9:30 PM, which is 45 minutes. By adding the one hour to the 45 minutes, we get the total duration of the movie, which is 1 hour and 45 minutes.\n\nExample 4\nInput:\nAn analog clock shows the hour hand on the 3 and the minute hand on the 6. What time is it?\n\nOutput:\nTo determine the time on an analog clock, we look at the positions of the hour and minute hands. The hour hand is pointing directly at the 3, which indicates the hour. The minute hand is pointing at the 6, and since each number on the clock represents 5 minutes, the 6 corresponds to 30 minutes (6 times 5 minutes). Therefore, the time displayed on the clock is 3:30.\n\nExample 5\nInput:\nA meeting is scheduled for 10:00 AM in London. If you are in Tokyo, where the local time is 9 hours ahead of London, what time should you join the meeting?\n\nOutput:",
